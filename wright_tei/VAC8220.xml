CHAPTER I.&#xD;
&#xD;
W EDNESDAY morning was cold and raw, and the&#xD;
sun presently put on a thick grey cloak. There&#xD;
were suspicions abroad that it was one made in the regions&#xD;
of perpetual snow, for whatever effect it might have had&#xD;
upon the sun, it made the earth very cold. Now and then&#xD;
a little frozen-up snowflake came silently down, and the&#xD;
wind swept fitfully round the corners of houses, and wan~&#xD;
dered up and down the chimneys. People who were out&#xD;
subsided into a little trot to keep themselves warm, all ex-&#xD;
cept the younger part of creation,, who made the trot a run;&#xD;
and those who could, staid at home.&#xD;
All of Mrs. Derrick's little family were of this latter&#xD;
class, after the very early morning; for as some, of them&#xD;
were to brave the weather at night, there seemed no reason&#xD;
why they should also brave it by day. As speedily as might&#xD;
be, Mr. Linden dispatched his various matters of. outdoor&#xD;
business, and came back to look for his scholar.&#xD;
The first thing she was set about was her French ex~reise,&#xD;
during the first few lines of which Mr. Linden stood by her&#xD;
and looked on. But then he suddenly turned away and&#xD;
went up stairs.-~returning however, presently, to take his&#xD;
usual seat by her side. He watched her progress silently,&#xD;
except for business words and instructions, till the exercise&#xD;
was finished ~tnd FaitW had turned to him for farther&#xD;
direction~; then taking her hand he put upon its forefinger&#xD;

&#xD;
one of the prettiest things she had ever seen. It was an&#xD;
old-fashioned diamond ring; the stones all of a size, and&#xD;
of great clearness and lustre, set close upon each other all&#xD;
the way round; with just enough goldsmith's work to bind&#xD;
them together, and to form a dainty frill of filagree work&#xD;
above and below-looking almost like a gold line of&#xD;
shadow by that flashing line of light.&#xD;
"It was my mother's, Faith," he said, "and she gave it&#xD;
to me in trust for whatever lady I should love as I love&#xD;
you."&#xD;
Faith looked down at it with very, very grave eyes. Her&#xD;
head bent lower, and then suddenly laying her hands to-&#xD;
gether on the table she hid her face in them; and the&#xD;
diamonds glittered against her temple and in contrast with&#xD;
the neighboring soft hair.&#xD;
One or two mute questions came there, before Mr.&#xD;
Linden said softly, "Faith !" She looked up with flushed&#xD;
face, and all of tears in her eyes but the tears; and her&#xD;
lip had its very unbent line. She looked first at him and&#xD;
then at the ring again. Anything more humble or more&#xD;
grave than her look cannot be imagined. His face was&#xD;
grave too, with a s9rt of moved gravity, that touched both&#xD;
the present and the past, but he did not mean hers should&#xD;
be..&#xD;
"Now what will you do, dear child ?" he said. "For I&#xD;
must forewarn you that there is a language of rings which&#xD;
is well established in the world."&#xD;
"What-do you mean ?" she said, looking alternately at&#xD;
~he ring and him.&#xD;
"You know~What plain gold on this finger means ?" he&#xD;
said, touching the one he spoke of. She looked at first&#xD;
doubtfully, then coloured and said "yes."&#xD;
"Well diamonds on this finger are understood to be the&#xD;
avant-couriers of that."&#xD;
Faith had never seen diamonds but that was not what&#xD;
she was thinking of nor what brought such a deep spot of&#xD;
colout' on her cheeks. It was pretty to see, it was so bright&#xD;
and so different from the flush which had been there a&#xD;
few minutes before. Her eyes, considered the diamonds&#xD;
attentively.&#xD;
"What shall I do ?" she said after a little.&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
"I don't know-you must try your powers of con-&#xD;
trivance."&#xD;
"I cannot contrive. I could keep my glove on to-night;&#xD;
but I could not every day. Shall I give it back to you to&#xD;
keep for me ?"-.--she said looking at it lovingly. "Per-&#xD;
haps that will be best !-.What would you like me to do ?"&#xD;
"Anything but that," he said smiling,-" I should say&#xD;
that would be worst. You may wear a glove, or glove-&#xD;
finger-.-what you will; but there it must stay, and keep&#xD;
possession for me, till the other one comes to bear it&#xD;
company. In fact I suppose I could endure to have it&#xD;
seen !"&#xD;
Her eyes went down to it again. Clearly the ring had a&#xD;
charm for Faith. And so it had, something beyond the&#xD;
glitter of brilliant. Of jewellers' value she knew little;&#xD;
the marketable worth of the thing was an enigma to her.&#xD;
But as a treasure of another kind it was beyond price. His&#xD;
mother's ring, on her finger-to Faith's fancy it bound and&#xD;
pledged her to a round of life as perfect, as bright, and as&#xD;
pure, as its own circlet of light-giving gems. That she&#xD;
might fill to him-as far as was possible-all the place&#xD;
that the once owner of the diamonds would have looked for&#xD;
and desired; and be all that he would look for in the per-&#xD;
son to whom the ring, so derived, had come. Faith c6n-&#xD;
sidered it lovingly, with intent brow, and at last lifted her&#xD;
eyes to Mr. Linden by way of answer; without saying&#xD;
anything, yet with half her thoughts in her face. His face&#xD;
was very grave-Faith could see. a little what ~the flashing&#xD;
of that ring was to him; but her look was met and answered&#xD;
with a fulness of warmth and tenderness which said that lie&#xD;
had read her thoughts, and that to his mind they were&#xD;
already accomplished. Then he took up one of her books&#xD;
and openedrit at the place where she was to read.&#xD;
The morning, and, the afternoon, went off all too fast,&#xD;
and the sun went down sullenly. A.s if to be in keeping&#xD;
with the expected change of work and company, the even-&#xD;
ing brought worse weather,-a keener wind-begi~nin~&#xD;
to bestir itself in earnest, a thicker sky; though the g~'ound&#xD;
was too snow-covered already to allow it to be very dark&#xD;
With anybody but Mr. Li~ en, Mrs. Derrick would hardly,&#xD;
have let Faith go out; an even as W was, sha seves~f&#xD;

times hoped the weather would moderate before they came&#xD;
home. Faith was so well wrapped up however, both in&#xD;
the house and in the sleigh, that the weather gave her no&#xD;
discomfort; it was rather exhilarating to be so warm in&#xD;
spite of it; and they flew along at a good rate, having the&#xD;
road pretty much to themselves.&#xD;
"Faith," Mr. Linden said as they approached Judge&#xD;
Harrison's, "I cannot spend all the evening here with&#xD;
you.-that is, I ought not. I had a message sent me this&#xD;
afternoon-too late to attend to then, which I cannot&#xD;
leave till morning. But if I see you safe by the fire, I&#xD;
hope Miss Harrison will take good care of you till I get&#xD;
back."&#xD;
"Well," said Faith,-" I wouldn't meddle with your&#xD;
'ought's,'-.if I could. I hope you'll take care of Jerry !"-.-.&#xD;
"What shall I do with him?'&#xD;
"Don't you know ?" said Faith demurely.&#xD;
"I suppose I ought to drive him so fast that he'll keep&#xD;
warm," said Mr. Linden. "What else ?"&#xD;
Faith's little laugh made a contrast with the rough night.&#xD;
"You had better let me get out to the fire," she said joy-&#xD;
fully,-" or I sha'n't keep warm."&#xD;
"You sha'n't ?" he said bending down by her, as they&#xD;
reached the door,-"your face has no idea of being cold!&#xD;
-I'll take care of Jerry, child-if I don't forget him in&#xD;
my own pleasant thoughts."&#xD;
Faith threw off her cloak and furs on the hall table where&#xD;
some Qthers lay, and pulled off one glove.&#xD;
"Keep them both on !" Mr. Linden said softly and&#xD;
smiling,-" enact Portia for once. Then if you are~ much&#xD;
urged, you can gracefully yield your own prejudices so far&#xD;
as to take off one."&#xD;
She looked at him, then amusedly pulled on her glove&#xD;
again; and the door was opened for them into a region of&#xD;
warmth and brightness; where there were all sorts of rc~.&#xD;
joicings over them and against the cold night. Mr. Linden&#xD;
was by force persuaded to wait till after coffee before&#xD;
braving it again; arid the Judge and his daughter fairly&#xD;
involved Faith in the ~neshes of their kindness. A very~'&#xD;
mouse Faith was to-ni~ht, as ever wore gloves; and ~with&#xD;
a little of a mouse's waN~hfulness about her? fancying~cat's&#xD;

ears at every corner. A brown mouse too; she had worn&#xD;
only her finest and best stuff dress. But upon the breast&#xD;
of that, a bunch of snowy Laurestinus, nestling among&#xD;
green leaves, put forth a secret claim in a way that was&#xD;
very beautifying. The Judge and Miss Sophy put her in&#xD;
a gieat soft velvet chair and hovered round her, both of&#xD;
them conscious of her being a little more dainty than usual.&#xD;
Sophy thought perhaps it was the Laurestinus; her father&#xD;
believed it intrinsic. /&#xD;
The coffee canie, and the doctor.&#xD;
"I have something better for you than Portia to-night'7&#xD;
-he said as he dealt out sugar,~" though not something&#xD;
better than muffins."&#xD;
"Faith, my dear child," said Miss Sophy,..-"you needn't&#xD;
be so cerenionious-none of us are wearing gloves."&#xD;
Faith laughed and blushed and pulled off one glove.&#xD;
"You are enacting Portia, are you ?" said Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
"Even she would not have handled wigs with them. I see&#xD;
I have done mischief! But the harm I did you last night&#xD;
I will undo this evening. Ladies and Gentlemen !-.-.I will&#xD;
give you, presently, the pleasure of hearing some lines&#xD;
written expressive of my wishes toward the unknown-but&#xD;
supposed-mistress of my life and affections. Any sug-&#xD;
gestions toward the bettering of them-I will hear."&#xD;
"The betteri~mg of whaV?" said Mrs. Somers,-."your&#xD;
life and affections ?"&#xD;
"I am aware, my dear aunt Ellen, you think the one&#xD;
impossible-.-the other improbable. I speak of bettering&#xD;
the wishes."&#xD;
"'Unknown but supposed"'-said Mr. Linden.-" 'Item&#xD;
-She ~hatli many nameless virtues'."&#xD;
"That is not my wish," said the doctor gravely lc~oking&#xD;
at him. "I think nameless virtues - deserve their ob~&#xD;
security !"&#xD;
"What do you call your ideal ?"&#xD;
"Psyche,-" said the doctor, after a~ minute's sober con-&#xD;
sideration apparently divided between Mr. Linden's face&#xD;
and the subject.&#xD;
* "That is not so uncommon a name as Campaspe," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden, with a queer little gesture of brow and lips.&#xD;
"Who is Cam paspe ?" said the doctor; while Faith&#xD;

looked, and Miss Essie's black eyes sparkled and danced,&#xD;
and everybody else held his coffee cup in abeyance.&#xD;
"Did you never hear of my Campaspe ?" said Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den, glancing~'up from under his brows.&#xD;
"We will ~exchange civilities," said the doctor. "I should&#xD;
be very happy to hear of her."&#xD;
Laughing a little, his own cup sending its persuasive&#xD;
steam unheeded, his own face on the sparkling order--.&#xD;
though the eyes looked demurely down,--.Mr. Linden went&#xD;
on to answer.&#xD;
"'Cupid and my Campaspe played&#xD;
At cards for kisses; Cupid payed;&#xD;
He stakes his quiver, bow and arrows,&#xD;
His mother's doves, and teame of sparrows;&#xD;
Loses them too; then down he throws&#xD;
The coi~al of his hippe, the rose&#xD;
Growing on's cheek, (but none knows how)&#xD;
With these, the crystal of his browe,&#xD;
And then the dimple of his chinne;&#xD;
All these did my Campaspe whine.&#xD;
At last he set her both his eyes,-&#xD;
She won, and Cupid blind did rise.&#xD;
0 Love! has she done this to thee?&#xD;
What shall, alas! become of me!"'&#xD;
There was a general little breeze of laughter and ap-&#xD;
plause. The doctor had glanced at Faith ;--her colour&#xD;
was certainly raised; but then the old Judge had just bent&#xD;
dawn to~ ask her "if she had ever heard of Campaspe be-&#xD;
fore ?" The doctor did not hear but he guessed at the&#xD;
whisper, and saw Faith's laugh and shake of the head.&#xD;
"Is that a true bill, Linden ?"&#xD;
"Very true,-" said Mr. Linden, trying his coffee. "But&#xD;
it is not yet known what will become of me."&#xD;
"What has become of Campaspe ~&#xD;
"She is using her eyes."&#xD;
"Are they those, eyes, Mr~ Linden ?" said~ Miss Essie&#xD;
coming nearer and using her own.&#xD;
"What was the coloi4r of Cupid's ?"&#xD;
"Blue, certainly !"&#xD;
"Miss Derrick !"-said the doctor,.--."let us have your&#xD;
opinion."&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                   9&#xD;
Faith gave him at least a frank view of her own all&#xD;
blushing and laughing as she was, and answered readily-.-..&#xD;
"As to the colour of Cupid's eyes ?--.J have never seen&#xD;
him, ~&#xD;
The doctor was obliged to laugh himself; and the chorus&#xD;
became general, at something in the combination of Faith&#xD;
and her words. But Faith's confusion thereupon mastered&#xD;
her so completely, that perhaps to shield her the doctor&#xD;
requested silence and attention and began to read; of a&#xD;
lady who, he said he was certain, had borrowed of nobody&#xD;
-~not even of Cupid.-&#xD;
"' Whoe'e~ she be,&#xD;
That not impossible she,&#xD;
That shall command my heart and me,' "--&#xD;
"1 believe she is impossible, to begin with," said Miss&#xD;
Essie. "You will never let any woman command you, Dr.&#xD;
"You don't know~ me, Miss Essie," said the doctor, with&#xD;
a curiously grave face, for him.&#xD;
"He means-.--&#xD;
1!&#xD;
'Who shall command my heai'L-not me,'"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"If she can command my heart-what of me is left to&#xD;
rebel ?" said the doctor.&#xD;
"Sophy," said Mrs. Somers, "how long has Julius been&#xD;
all heart ?"&#xD;
"Ever since my a~unt Ellen has been all eyes and ears.&#xD;
Mr. Somers, whicli portion of your mental nature owns the&#xD;
supremacy of your wife? may I inquire, in the course of&#xD;
this investigation ?"&#xD;
"Ha !" said Mr. Somers blandly, thus called upon-~" I&#xD;
own her supremacy sir-.-.ha-in all proper things !"&#xD;
"ha! Very proper !" said the doctor.&#xD;
"That is all any good woman wants," said the old Judge&#xD;
benignly. "I take it, that is all she wants." K&#xD;
"Then you must say which are the proper things,&#xD;
father I" said Miss Sophy laughing.&#xD;
"You'll have to ask every man separately, Sophy," said&#xD;
&#xD;

Mrs. Somers,-.~-" they all have their own ideas about proper&#xD;
things. Mr. Somers thinks milk porridge is the limit."&#xD;
"Mr. Stoutenburgh," said the doctor, "haven't you owned&#xD;
yourself commanded, ever since your heart gave up its lock&#xD;
and key ?"&#xD;
"Yes indeed," said the Squire earnestly,-" I am so&#xD;
bound up in slavery that I have even forgotten the wish&#xD;
to be free! All my wife's things are proper I"&#xD;
"0 hush I" his wife said laughing, but with a little quick&#xD;
bi~ight witness in her eyes, that was pretty to see. Dr.&#xD;
Harrison smiled.&#xD;
"You see, Miss Derrick I" he said with a little bow to&#xD;
her,-" there is witness on all sides ;-and now I will go on&#xD;
with my not impossible she."-.&#xD;
He got through several verses, not without several inter-&#xD;
ruptions, till he caine to the exquisite words following :-.&#xD;
"'I wish her beauty,&#xD;
That owes not all his duty&#xD;
To gaudy tire or glistring shoetye.&#xD;
'Something more than&#xD;
Taffeta or tissue can,&#xD;
Or rampant feather, or rich fan~.&#xD;
'More than the spoil&#xD;
Of shop, or silk-worm's toil,&#xD;
Or a bought blush, or a set smile.'"&#xD;
While Miss Essie exclaimed, Miss Harrison stole a look&#xD;
at Faith; who was looking up at the doctor, listening, with&#xD;
a very simple face of amusement. Her thoughts were in-&#xD;
deed better ballasted than to sway to such a breeze if she had&#xD;
felt it. But the real extreme beauty of the image and of&#xD;
the delineation was what she felt; she made no application&#xD;
of them. The doctor came to this verse.&#xD;
"'A well-tamed heart,&#xD;
For whose more no~Sle smart&#xD;
Love may be long choosing a dart.'-.&#xD;
What does that mean, Linden ?-.-isn't that an error in&#xD;

"Poetical license," said Mr. Linden smiling. "Psyche&#xD;
will give you trouble enough, wings and al1,-there~ is no&#xD;
fear you will find her 'tamed'."&#xD;
"How i3 Campaspe in that respect ?"&#xD;
"She has never given me much trouble yet," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden.&#xD;
"What I object to is the 'long choosing '," said the doc-&#xD;
tor. "Miss de Staff-do you think a good heart should be&#xD;
very hard to win ?"&#xD;
"Certainly I-the harder the better," replied the lady.&#xD;
"That's the only way to bring down your pride. The&#xD;
harder she is, the more likely you are to think she's a&#xD;
diamond."&#xD;
"Mrs. Stoutenburgh I".-&#xD;
"What has been the texture of yours all these years,&#xD;
doctor?"&#xD;
"He thinks that when he has dined the rest &amp;amp;f the world&#xD;
should follow suit-like the Khan of Tartary," said Mrs.&#xD;
Somers.&#xD;
"Miss Derrick !" said the doctor.~-.-~"I hope for some&#xD;
gentleness from you. Do you think such a heart as w~&#xD;
have been talking of, should be very difficult to move ?"&#xD;
Faith's blush was exquisite. Real speech was hard to&#xD;
command. She knew all eyes~were waiting upon her; and&#xD;
s~e could not reason out and comfort her~1ff with the truth&#xD;
.-.--that to them her blush might mean several things as well&#xD;
as one. The answer caine in that delic ~te voice of hers&#xD;
which timidity had shaken&#xD;
"I ,thiflkjt depends on w\at there is to. move it."&#xD;
"What do you call sufficient force ?" said Mrs. Somers.&#xD;
"I ?"-said Faith.-&#xD;
"Yes, you," replied the parson's wife with a look not&#xD;
unkindly amused. "What sort and degree of power should&#xD;
move 'such a heart'?-to quote Julius."&#xD;
Faith's blush was painful ~gain, and it was only the sheer&#xD;
necessity of the case that enabled her to rally. But her&#xD;
answer was clear. "Something better than itself, IMA's.&#xD;
Somers."                                        I&#xD;
"I should like to know what that is I" said Mrs. Somers.&#xD;

&#xD;
different tone, but rather drew eyes upon himself than&#xD;
Faith.&#xD;
"It's of no consequence to you !" said the doctor, with&#xD;
a funny, mock serious tone of admonition.&#xD;
Mr.~ Linden bowed, acquiescingly.-" Psychology is an&#xD;
interesting study "-he added, in qualification. "But let&#xD;
me return your warning, doctor-you have a formidable&#xD;
rival"          -&#xD;
"Qul donc ?"&#xD;
"Cupid carried off Psyche some time ago-do you sup..&#xD;
pose you can get her back ?" And with a laughing sign&#xD;
of adieu, Mr. Linden went away.&#xD;
Luckily for Faith, she was not acquainted with the hea-&#xD;
then mythology; and was also guiltless of any thought of&#xD;
connexion between herself and the doctor's ideal. So her&#xD;
very free, unsuspicious face and laughter quite reassured&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden is an odd sort of person," said Miss Essie&#xD;
philosophically. "I have studied him a good deal, and I&#xD;
can't quite make him out. He's a very interesting man!&#xD;
But I think he is deeper than li seems."&#xD;
"He's deeper than the salt mines of Salzburg then !"&#xD;
said the doctor.&#xD;
"Why ?" said Miss Essie curiously.&#xD;
The doctor answered gravely that "there were beautiful&#xD;
things there "~-..and went on with his reading. And Faith&#xD;
listened now with unwavering attention, till he came to-&#xD;
"'Sydnean showers&#xD;
Of soft discourse, whose powers&#xD;
Can crown old winter's head with flowers."'&#xD;
Faith's mind took a leap. And it hardly came back&#xD;
again. The reading was followed by a very lively roii~d&#xD;
game of talk* but it was not such talk; and Faith's&#xD;
thoughts wandered away and watched round that circlet&#xD;
of brightness that was covered by her glove; scattered rays&#xD;
from which led them variously,-home, to her Sunday&#xD;
school to Pequot,.-and to heaven; coming back again&#xD;
and again to the diamonds and to the image that was in&#xD;
the centre of them. No wonder her grave sweet face was&#xD;
remarked as being even graver and sweeter than usual;&#xD;
&#xD;
12&#xD;
&#xD;
2I&#xD;
&#xD;
and the doctor at last devoted himselff to breaking up its&#xD;
quiet. lie took her into the library to finish the Rhodo-&#xD;
dendrons-.ostensibly.--.-but in reality to get rid of the stiff&#xD;
circle in the other room. The circle followed; but no&#xD;
longer stiff; under the influence of the cold weather and&#xD;
the big fires and good prompting, their spirits got up at&#xD;
last to the pitch of acting charades. Miss Harrison brought&#xD;
down her stores of old and new finery; and with much zeal&#xD;
and success charades and tableaux went on for some length&#xD;
of time; to the extreme amusement of Faith, who had never&#xD;
seen any before. They did not divert her from watching&#xD;
for the sound of Mr. Linden's return; but it came not, and&#xD;
Miss Essie expected and hoped aloud in vain. The hour&#xD;
did come, and passed, at which such gatherings in Patta~&#xD;
quasset were wont to break up. That was not very late to&#xD;
be sure. The Stoutenburghs, and the De Staffs, and finally;,&#xD;
~r. and Mrs. Somers, went off in turn; and Faith was left&#xD;
alone to wait; for she had refused all offers of being set&#xD;
down by her various friends.&#xD;
It happened that Mr. Linden had been, by no harmful&#xD;
accident but simply by )he untowardness of things, delayed&#xD;
beyond his time; and then having a good distance to drive,&#xD;
it was some while after the last visitors had departed when&#xD;
he once more reined up Jerry at the door. No servant&#xD;
came to take him, and Mr. Linden applied himself to the&#xD;
bell-handle. But there seemed a spell upon the house-..or&#xD;
else the inmates were asleep-for ring as he would, no one&#xD;
came.&#xD;
To fasten Jerry and let himself in were the neat steps-&#xD;
neither of which took long. But in the drawing-room, to&#xD;
which he had been ushered in the beginning of the evening,&#xD;
there was now no one. The lights and the fires and the&#xD;
empty chairs were there; that was all. Mr. Linden knew&#xD;
the house well enough to know where next to look; he&#xD;
crossed the hall to a roam at the other side, which was the&#xD;
one most commonly used by the family, and from which a&#xD;
passage led to the library. No one was here, and the room&#xD;
was in a strange state of confusion. Before he had well&#xD;
time to remark upon it, Faith came in from the passage&#xD;
bearing a heavy marble bust in jier arms. The colour&#xD;
sprang to her cheeks; she set down Prince Talleyrand&#xD;
von. Il.                2&#xD;

quickly and came towards Mr. Linden, saying, "There's fire $&#xD;
in the library."&#xD;
"My dear child!" he said softly, "what is the matter?&#xD;
~Vhat are you about?"&#xD;
"Why there is fire in the library-it's all on fire, or soon&#xD;
will be," she said hurriedly, "and we are bringing the~things&#xD;
out. The fire can't get in here-its a fireproof building-&#xD;
only the inside will all burn up. The servants are carrying&#xD;
water to the roof of the house, lest that should catch. IL&#xD;
am so glad to see you !"-&#xD;
And Miss Sophy and the doctor came in, carrying one a&#xD;
picture, the other an armful of books. Faith ran back&#xD;
through the passage. But before she could set her foot&#xD;
inside the library, Mr. Linden'~ hand was on her shoulder,&#xD;
and he stepped before her and took the survey of the room&#xD;
in one glance.&#xD;
Its condition was sufficiently unpromising. The fire h~d&#xD;
kindled in a heap of combustible trumpery brought there&#xD;
for the tableaux. lilt had got far beyond management be~&#xD;
fore any one discovered it; and now was making fast work&#xD;
in that corner of the room and creeping with no slow pro-&#xD;
gress along the cornices of the bookshelves. Short time&#xD;
evidently there was for the famIly to remove their treasures&#xD;
from itS destructive sweep. One corner of the room was&#xD;
in a light blaze; one or two lamps mockingly joined their&#xD;
light to the glare; the smoke was curling in grey wreaths&#xD;
and clouds over and around almost everything. Here an&#xD;
exquisite bust of Proserpine looked forlornly through it;&#xD;
and there a noble painting of Alston's showed in richer&#xD;
lights than ever before, its harmony of coloring. The ser-&#xD;
vants were, as Faith had said, engaged in endeavoring to&#xD;
keep the roof of the house from catching; only one old&#xD;
black retainer of the family, too infirm for that service, was&#xD;
helping them in the labour of rescuing books and treasures&#xD;
of art from the fire, which must take its way within the&#xD;
library. The wall it could not pass, that being, as Faith&#xD;
had also said, proof against it.&#xD;
"Stay where you are," Mr. Linden said, "and I will&#xD;
hand things to you"-addiug under his breath, "if you&#xD;
love me, Faith 1" And passing into the room he snatched&#xD;
&#xD;
Proserpine from her smoky berth and gave her to the old&#xD;
servant, hand~g Faith a light picture.&#xD;
"Don't let your sister come in here, Harrison," he said,&#xD;
springing up the steps to the upper shelves of the bookcase&#xD;
nearest the fire-" and don't let everybody do everything,..-..&#xD;
keep half in the passage and half here."&#xD;
"Yes, Sophy," said the doctor, "that is much better-..-.&#xD;
"don't you come in here, nor Miss Faith. And don't work&#xD;
too hard," he said gently to the lai4er as she came back&#xD;
after bestowing the picture. "I won't ask you not to work&#xD;
at all, for I know it would be of no use."&#xD;
"Just work like monkeys," Mr. Linden said from his&#xD;
high post, which was a rather invisible one. "Reuben !-..-&#xD;
I am glad of your help."&#xD;
"Reuben I" exclaimed Faith joyously. "How good that&#xD;
is. Give me those books, Reuben.".-..&#xD;
And after that the ~work went on steadily, with few words.&#xD;
It was too smoky an atmosphere to speak much in; and the&#xD;
utmost exertions on the part of every one of the workers&#xD;
left no strength nor time for it. "Like monkeys" they&#xD;
worked-th&amp;amp; gentlemen handing things out of the smoke&#xD;
to the willing fingers and light fect that made quick dispo-&#xD;
sition of them. Quick it had need to be, for the fire was&#xD;
not waiting for them. And in an incredibly short time~&#xD;
incredible save to those who have seen the experiment&#xD;
tried,-books and engravings were emptied from shelf after&#xD;
shelf.-.-eompartment after compartment.-....and lodged within&#xD;
the house. Not a spare inch of space-..not a spare second&#xD;
9f time, it seemed, was gone over; and the treasures of the&#xD;
library were in quick process of shifting from one place to&#xD;
another. It was rather a weary part Faith had to play,.~-...&#xD;
to stop short at the doorway and see the struggle with&#xD;
smoke and fire that was going on inside; and~u~ anxious&#xD;
eye and trembling heart followed the movements of one of&#xD;
the workers theve whenever she returned to her p9st of&#xD;
waiting. She would rather have been amid the smoke and&#xD;
the fire too, than to stand off looking on; but she did what&#xD;
she was desired-and more than she was desired; for she&#xD;
said not a word, like a wise child. Only did her work with&#xD;
no delay and came back again. Two excellent workers&#xD;

were the doctor and Mr. Linden; Reuben was a capital&#xD;
seconder; and no better runners than the two ladies need&#xD;
have been found; while the old Judge and his old serving&#xD;
man did what they could. There was every appearance&#xD;
that their efforts would be successful; the fire was to be&#xD;
sure, greatly increased and fast spreading b so also the&#xD;
precious things that it endangered were a re dy in great&#xD;
measure secured. Probably very little would have been&#xD;
lost to be regretted, if the workers had not suffered a slight&#xD;
interruption.&#xD;
Mr. Linden was in the middle of the room unlocking the&#xD;
drawers of the library table, which was too large to be re-&#xD;
moved. Old Nero, the black man, had' taken one of the&#xD;
lamps which yet remained burning, a large heairy one, to&#xD;
carry away. He was just opposite the table, when a stone bust&#xD;
of some weight, which had stood above the bookcases, de-&#xD;
tached by the failure of its supports, came down along with&#xD;
some spars of the burning wood and fell against a rich&#xD;
screen just on ~the other side of Nero. The screen was&#xD;
thrown over 0A him; he struggled an instant to right him~&#xD;
self and it, holding his lamp off at an awful angle towards&#xD;
Mr. Linden; then, nobody could tell how it was, Nero had&#xD;
saved himself and struggled out from the falling screen and&#xD;
burning wood, and Faith and the lamp lay under it, just at&#xD;
Mr. L'inden's feet. Yet hardly under it-so instantly was&#xD;
it thrown off. The lamp was not broken, which was a&#xD;
wonder; but Faith was stunned, and the burning wood had&#xD;
touched her brow and singed a lock of hair.&#xD;
In such a time of confusion all sorts of things come and&#xD;
go, unseen but by the immediate actors. Dr. Harrison&#xD;
and Reuben were intent upon a heavy picture; the Judge&#xD;
and his daughter were in the other room. And Faith was&#xD;
lifted up and borne swiftly along to the drawing-room sofa,&#xD;
and there was cold water already on her brow, before the&#xD;
others reached her. She was only a little stunned and had&#xD;
opened her eyes when they came up. They came round&#xD;
her, all the gang of workers, like a swarm of bees, and with&#xD;
as many questions and inquiries. Faith smiled at them all,&#xD;
and begged they would go back and finish what they were&#xD;
doing.&#xD;
"i'll stay here a little while," she said; "my fall didn't&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
Vt&#xD;
&#xD;
hurt me~ a bit, to speak of. Do g4 don't anybody wait&#xD;
for me."&#xD;
There seemed nothing else to be done; she would own&#xD;
to wanting nothing'; and her urgency at length prevailed&#xD;
with ,them, however reluctantly, to leave her and go back&#xD;
to the library. But Mr. Linden stood still as the others&#xD;
moved off.&#xD;
"Where are you hurt ?" he said in a low voice.&#xD;
"I suppose the fall bruised me a little bit. It didn't do&#xD;
mc any real harm. Don't wait here for me."&#xD;
"Where ?" Mr. Linden said.&#xD;
"Where it bruised me? A little on my head-and&#xD;
elbow-and side; altogether nothing !"&#xD;
He sat down by her, passing his hand softly over tjie&#xD;
scorched hair; then said, "Let me see your arm."&#xD;
"Oh no !-that's not necessary. I said I was bruised,&#xD;
bat it isn't much."&#xD;
"Faith, you have not told me the whole."&#xD;
Her eye shrank from his instantly, and her colour flitted&#xD;
from red to pale.&#xD;
"There is nothing more I need tell you. They will all&#xD;
be back here-or some\of them-if you stay. I'll tell you&#xD;
anything you please to morrow," she added with a smile.&#xD;
But he 'only repeated, "Tell me now-I have a right to&#xD;
know."&#xD;
Her lip took its childish look, but hereye met him now.&#xD;
"Don't look so !"---she said, "as if tlier~ was any reason for&#xD;
it. I think some of the fluid from that lamp ran down on&#xD;
my arm-and it smarts. Don't stay here to look grave&#xD;
about me !-it isn't necessary."&#xD;
lie bent his head and gave her one answer to all that-.--.&#xD;
then sprang up and went for Dr. Harrison. Faith tried to&#xD;
hinder him, in vain.&#xD;
There was little now to detain anybody in the library,&#xD;
he found, and a good deal to drive everybody out of it.&#xD;
The fire had seemed to take advantage of its unwatched&#xD;
opportunity and had put it pretty well out of any one's&#xD;
power to rescue much more from its rapacity. Reuben&#xD;
and Dr. Harrison were carrying out the drawers of the&#xD;
table, which Mr. Linden had been unlocking; and the&#xD;
doctor dropped the one' he held the instant he caught the&#xD;

sense of Mr. Linden's words. He went through the other&#xD;
way, summoning his sister.&#xD;
Faith was lying very quietly and smiled at them, but her&#xD;
colour went and came with odd suddenness. She would&#xD;
not after all let the doctor touch her; but rising from&#xD;
the sofa said she would go up stairs and let Sopliy see&#xD;
what was wanting. The three went up, and Mr. Linden&#xD;
was left alone.&#xD;
He stood still for a moment where they left him, resting&#xD;
his face upon his hand, but then he went back to the burn-.&#xD;
ing room; and stationing himself at the doorway, bade all&#xD;
the rest keepback, and those that could to bring him water.&#xD;
Reuben sprang to this work~as he had done to the other;&#xD;
some of the servants had come down by this time; and Mr.&#xD;
Linden stood there, dashing the water about the doorway&#xD;
and into the room, upon the floor, the great table, and such&#xD;
of the bookcases as he could come near. The effect was&#xD;
soon evident. The blazing bits of carved moulding as they&#xD;
fell to the floor, went oiit instead of getting help to burn;&#xD;
and the heavier shelves and wainscot which being of hard&#xD;
wood burned slowly, begti~n to give out steam as well as&#xD;
smoke. The door and doorway were now perfectly safe-&#xD;
the fire hardly could spread into the passage, a danger&#xD;
which had been imminent when Mr. Lin~len came, but&#xD;
which the family ~emed to have forgotten; secure in their&#xD;
fireproof walls, they forgot the un-fireproof floor, nor seemed&#xD;
to remember how far along the passage The cinders might&#xD;
drift. When there was really nothing more for him ~to do,&#xD;
and he had given the servants very special instructions as&#xD;
to the watch they should Jieep, then and~ not till then did&#xD;
Mr. Linden return to the parlour; the glow of his severe&#xD;
exercise fading away.&#xD;
He found the Judge there, who engaged him in not too&#xD;
welcome conversation; but there was no help for it. He&#xD;
must hear and answer the old gentleman's thanks for his&#xD;
great services that night-praises of his conduct and of&#xD;
Faith's conduct; speculations and questions concerning the&#xD;
evenings disaster. After a time that seemed tedious,&#xD;
though it was not really very long, Miss Harrison came&#xD;
down.&#xD;
"She'll be better directly," she said. "Do sit down, Mr.&#xD;
&#xD;
Linden !-T have ordered some refreshments-you must&#xD;
want them, I should think; and you'll have to wait a little&#xD;
while, for Faith says she will go home with you; though&#xD;
I am sure she ought not, and Julius says she must not&#xD;
stir. '.'&#xD;
Mr. Linden bowed slightly-answering in the most com-&#xD;
monplace way that he was in no hurry and in no need of&#xD;
refreshments; and probably he felt also in no need of rest&#xD;
....4or he remained standing.&#xD;
"How is she, dear? how is she ?" said the Judge. "Is&#xD;
she much hurt ?"&#xD;
"Just now," said Miss Harrison, "she is in such pain&#xD;
that she cannot move - but we have put something on&#xD;
that will take away the pain, Julius says, in fifteen min-&#xD;
utes; and she will be quite well this time to-morrow, he&#xD;
says.~~&#xD;
"But is she much hurt ?" Judge Harrison repeated with&#xD;
a very concerned face.&#xD;
"She'll be well to-morrow, father; but she was dread-&#xD;
fully burned-her arm and shoulder-I thought she would&#xD;
have fainted upstairs-but I don't know whether people&#xD;
can faint when they are in such pain. I don't see how she&#xD;
can bear her dress to go home, but she says she will; Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick would be frightened. Mr. Linden, they say every-&#xD;
body does what you tell' them - I wish you'd persuade&#xD;
Faith to stay with me to-night! She won't hear me."&#xD;
"How soon can I see her ?"-The voice made Miss&#xD;
Harrison look-but her eyes said her ears had made a mis-&#xD;
take.&#xD;
"Why she said she would come down stairs presently-&#xD;
as soon as the pain went off enough to let her do anything&#xD;
-and she wanted me to tell you so; but I am sure it's&#xD;
very wrong. Do, Mr. Linden, take something !"- (the&#xD;
servant had brought in a tray of meats and wine)~.b" While&#xD;
you're waiting, you may as well rest yourself. How shall&#xD;
we ever thank you for what you've done to-night W'&#xD;
Miss Harrison spoke under some degree of agitation, but&#xD;
both she and her father failed in no kind or grateful shew&#xD;
of feeling towards their guest.&#xD;
"How did it happen, Mr. Linden ?" she said when she&#xD;
had done in this kind all she could.&#xD;

He said he had not seen the accident-only its results.&#xD;
"I can't imagine how Faith got there," said Miss ilar-&#xD;
rison. "She saw the screen coming over on Nero, I sup~&#xD;
pose, and thought she could save the lamp-she made one&#xD;
spring from the doorway, he says, to where he stood. And&#xD;
in putting up her hand to the lamp, I suppose that horrid&#xD;
fluid ran down her arm and on her sl~w~ilder-when Nero&#xD;
put out the la~p he must have loos eiied[ the fastening; it&#xD;
went all over her shoulder. But she'll be well to-morrow&#xD;
night, Julius says."&#xD;
"Who's with her now, my dear ?" said the Judge.&#xD;
"0 Julius is with her-he said he'd stay ~rith her till I&#xD;
came back-.she wanted Mr. Linden to know she would go&#xD;
home with him. Now, Mr. Linden, won't you send her&#xD;
word back that you'll take care of Mrs. Derrick if she'll&#xD;
stay ?"&#xD;
"I will go up and see her, Miss harrison."&#xD;
That was anticipated however, by the entrance of the&#xD;
doctor; who told his sister Miss Derrick wanted her help,&#xD;
then came gravely to the table, poured out a glass of wine&#xD;
and drank it. His father asked questions, which he an-&#xD;
swered briefly. Miss Derrick felt better-she was going to&#xD;
get up and come down stairs.&#xD;
"But oug~~t she to be suffered to go out to-night, Julius?&#xD;
-such a night?"&#xD;
"Certainly not 1"&#xD;
The Judge argued the objections to her going. The&#xD;
doctor made no answer. He walked up and down the&#xD;
room, and Mr. Linden stood still. Ten or fifteen minutes&#xD;
passed; and then the door opened softly and Faith, all&#xD;
dressed, cloaked, and furred, came in with her hood, fob&#xD;
lowed by her friend. Miss Sophy looked very ill satisfied.&#xD;
Faith's face was pale enough, but as serenely happy as&#xD;
release from pain can leave a face that has no care behind.&#xD;
A white embodiment of purity and gentleness she looked.&#xD;
The doctor was at her side' instantly, asking questions.&#xD;
Mr. Linden d~d not in.terrapt hirn,-he had met her almost&#xD;
before the doctor, and taken her hand with a quietness&#xD;
through which Faith could perceive the stir of feelings&#xD;
that might have swept those of all the others out into the&#xD;
snow. But he held her hand silently until other people&#xD;

&#xD;
had done their questions-then simply asked if she was&#xD;
quite sure she was fit to ride home? Then, with that&#xD;
passing of the harrier, look and voice did change a little.&#xD;
"1 mean to go,"-she said without looking at him,-.--"if&#xD;
you'll please to take me."&#xD;
"Sh&amp;amp; ought not,-J am sure she ought not !" exclaimed&#xD;
Miss Harrison in much vexation. "She is just able to&#xD;
stand."&#xD;
"You know," Mr. Linden said,-not at all as if lie was&#xD;
urging her, but merely making a statement he thought best&#xD;
to make; "I could even bring your mother here, in a very&#xD;
short time, if you wishe dit."1&#xD;
"0 I don't )vish it. I can go home very well now."&#xD;
lle% gave her his arm without more words. Miss Harri-&#xD;
son aThd the Judge followed Tegretfully. to the door; the&#xD;
doctor to the sleigh.&#xD;
"Are you well wrapped up ?" he asked.&#xD;
"I have got all my own and all Sophy's furs," said Faith&#xD;
in a glad tone of voice.&#xD;
"Take care of yourself;" he said ;-' 'and Mr. Linden,&#xD;
you must take care of her-which is more to the pi~rpose.&#xD;
If I had it to do, this ride would not be taken. Linden-~&#xD;
I'll thank you another time."&#xD;
They drove off. Bat as soon as they were a few steps&#xD;
from the house, Mr. Linden put hi~ arm about Faith and&#xD;
held her so that she could lean against him and rest; giv-&#xD;
ing her complete support, and muffling up the furs about&#xD;
her lightly and effectually, till it was hardly possible for the&#xD;
cold air to win through; and so drove her home. Not&#xD;
with many words,-with only a whispered question now&#xD;
and then, whether she was cold, or wanted any change of&#xD;
posture. The wind had lulled, and it was much milder,&#xD;
and the snow was beginning to fall softly and fast; Faith&#xD;
could feel the snow crystals on his face whenever it touched&#xD;
hers. Mr. Linden would have perhaps chosen to drive&#xD;
gently, as being easier for her, but the thick air made it&#xD;
needful. Once only he asked any other question..-.&#xD;
"Faith-is my care of you in fault, that it lets you come&#xD;
home ?"&#xD;
"No, I think not," she said ;--.-" you hold me just so&#xD;
nicely as it is possible to be! and this snow-storm is bea~~&#xD;

tified to her need of precisely the care he was giving her.&#xD;
"Are you suffering much now, dear child ?"&#xD;
"Not at all. I am only enjoying. I like being out&#xD;
in such a storm as this.-Only I am afraid mother is&#xD;
troubled)'&#xD;
"No-I sent Reuben down some time ago, to answer&#xD;
Ks her questions if she was up, and to have a good fire ready&#xD;
for yqu.~~&#xD;
"0 that's good !" she said. And then rested, in how&#xD;
luxurious a rest I. after exertion, and after anxiety, and&#xD;
after pain; so cared for and guarded. She could almost&#xD;
have gone to sleep to the tinkle of Jerry's bells; only that&#xD;
her spirit was too wide awake for that and the pleasure of&#xD;
the time too good to be lost. She had not all the pleasure&#xD;
to herself-Faith could feel that, every time Mr. Linden&#xD;
spoke or touched her; but what a different atmosphere his&#xD;
mind was in, frofn her quiet rest! Pain had quitted her,&#xD;
but not him, though the kinds were different. Truly he&#xD;
~would have borne any amount of physical pain himself, to&#xD;
cancel that which. she had sufThred,-there were some&#xD;
minutes of the ride when he would have borne it, only to&#xD;
lose the thought of that. But Faith knew nothing of it&#xD;
all, except as she could feel once or twice a deep breath&#xD;
that' was checked and hushed, and turned into some sweet&#xD;
low-spoken word to her; and her rest was very deep. So&#xD;
deep, that the stopping of the sleigh at last, was an inter-&#xD;
ruption.&#xD;
The moment Jerry's bells rang their little summons at&#xD;
the door, the door itself opened, and from the glimmering&#xD;
light Reuben ran out to take the reins.&#xD;
"Is Mrs. Derrick up ?" Mr. Linden asked, when the first&#xD;
inquiry about Faith had been answered.&#xD;
"I don't know, sir. I told her you were afraid Miss&#xD;
Faith would take cold without a fire in her room-and she&#xD;
let me take up wood and make it; and then she said she&#xD;
wasn't sleepy, and she 'd take care it didn't go out. I&#xD;
haven't seen her since."&#xD;
"Thank you, Reuben-now hold Jerry for me,-I shall(~&#xD;
keep you here to-night," Mr. Linden said as he stepped&#xD;
out. And laying his hand upon the furs and wrappers? he&#xD;

said ~oftly,-J' Little Esquimaux........do you think you can&#xD;
walk to the house ?"&#xD;
"0 yes !.-certainly."&#xD;
A little bit of a laugh answered her..-..the first she had&#xD;
heard since Campaspe; and then she was softly lifted up,&#xD;
an~l borne into the house over the new-fallen snow as&#xD;
lightly as if she had been a snowflake herself. The snow&#xD;
might lay its white feathei~a' upon her hood, but Faith felt&#xD;
as if she were in a cradle instead of a snow-storm. She&#xD;
was placed in the easy chair before the sitting-room fire,&#xD;
and her hood and furs quickly taken off. "How do you&#xD;
feel ?" Mr. Linden asked her.&#xD;
She looked like one of the flakes of snow herself, for&#xD;
simplicity and colour; but there was a smile in her eyes&#xD;
and lips that had come from a climate where roses blow.&#xD;
"I feel nicely..~..0nly a little bruised and battered feel-&#xD;
which isn't unpleasant."&#xD;
Will you have anything ?-a cup of tea ?-~--that might&#xD;
do you good."&#xD;
Faith looked dubious at the cup of tea; but then rose&#xD;
up and said it would disturb her mother, and she would&#xD;
just go and sleep.&#xD;
"It won't disturb her a bit,"-.-.Mr. Linden said, reseating&#xD;
her,-~2" sit still-I'll send Reuben up to see."&#xD;
He left her there a very few minutes, apparently attend-&#xD;
ing to more than one thing, for he came back through the&#xD;
eating-room door; bringing word to Faith that her fire&#xD;
and room were in nice order, and her mother fast asleep&#xD;
there in the rocking-chair to keep. guard; and that she&#xD;
should have a cup of tea in no time. And with a smile at&#xD;
her,, he went back into the eating-room, and brought thence&#xD;
her cup and plate, and requested to be told just how the&#xD;
tea should be made to please her, and whether he might&#xD;
invade the dairy for cream.&#xD;
"If I could put this cloak over my shoulders, I would&#xD;
get some myself. Will you put it on for me? please.-Js&#xD;
there fire in the kitchen? I'll go and make the tea."&#xD;
"Is there nothing else you would like to do ?" he said&#xD;
standing before her,.-.---"you shall not stir! Do you think&#xD;
I don't know cream when I see it ?".-and he went oil'&#xD;
again, coming back this time in company with Reuben and&#xD;

the tea-kettle, but the former did not stay. Then with ap-&#xD;
peals to her for directions the tea was made and poured&#xD;
out, and toast made and laid on her plate; but she was not&#xD;
allowed to raise a finger, except now to handle her cup.&#xD;
"It's very good !" said Faith,-" but-don't you remem-&#xD;
~ber you once told me two cups of cocoa were better than&#xD;
one&#xD;
It is to be noted in passing, .that all Faith's nameless&#xD;
addresses were made with a certain gentle, modulated ac-&#xD;
cent, which invariably implied in its half timid respect the&#xD;
'Mr. Linden' which she rarely forgot now she was not to&#xD;
say.&#xD;
"Dear child! I do indeed," he said, as if the remembrance&#xD;
were a bright one. "But I remember too that my opinion&#xD;
was negative. Faith, I used to wish then that I could&#xD;
wait upon you-but I would rather have you wait upon&#xD;
me, after all !"&#xD;
Faith utterly disallowed the tone of these last words,&#xD;
and urged her request in great earnest. He laughed at&#xD;
her a little-but brought the cup and drank the tea,-cer-&#xD;
tainly more to please her than himself; watching her the&#xD;
while, to see if the refreshment were telling upon her&#xD;
cheeks. She was very, little satisfied with his perform-&#xD;
ance.&#xD;
"Now I'll go and wake up mother," she said at last&#xD;
rising. "Don't think of this evening again but to be glad&#xD;
of everything that has happened. I am."&#xD;
"I fear, I fear," he said looking at her, "that your glad-&#xD;
ness and my sorrow meet on common ground. Child, what&#xD;
shall I do with you ?"-but what he did with her then was&#xD;
to put her in that same cradle and carry her softly upstairs,&#xD;
to the very door of her room.&#xD;

CHAPTER IT.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE same soft snow-storm was corn down when Faith&#xD;
I opened her eyes next morning; the air Io6ked like a&#xD;
white sheet; but in her room a bright fire was blazing,&#xD;
reddeniiig the white walls, and by her side sat Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
watching her. Very gentle and tender were the hands&#xD;
that helped her dress, and then Mrs. Derrick said she would&#xD;
go down and see to breakfast for a little while.&#xD;
"Wasn't it good your room was warm last ni~ht ?" she&#xD;
saN, stroking' Faith's hair.&#xD;
Faith's eyes acknowledged that.&#xD;
"And wasn't it good you were asleep !" she said laugh-&#xD;
ing and kissing Mrs. Derrick. "Mother ! - I was so&#xD;
glad!"&#xD;
That's the funny part of it," said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"Reuben's just about as queer in his way as Mr. Linden.&#xD;
The only thing I thought from the way he gave the mes-&#xD;
sage, was that somebody cared a good deal about his new&#xD;
possession-.-which I suppose is true," she added smiling;&#xD;
"and so I just went to sleep.)~&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick went down; and Faith knelt on the rug&#xD;
before the fire and bent her heart and head over her bible.&#xD;
In great happiness ;-in great endeavour that her happiness&#xD;
should stand well based on its true foundations~ and not&#xD;
shift from them to any other. In sober endeavour to lay&#xD;
hold, and feel that she had hold, of the happiness that can~&#xD;
not be taken away; to make sure that her feet were on a&#xD;
rock, before she stooped to take the sweetness of the&#xD;
flowers around her. And to judge by her face, she had&#xD;
felt the rock and the flowers both,~ before she left her&#xD;
room.&#xD;
The moment she opened her door and went out into the&#xD;
hall, Mr. Linden opened his,-.~-or rather it was already&#xD;
~open, and he came out, meeting her at the head of. the&#xD;
stairs. And after his first greeting, he held her still and&#xD;
looked at her for a moment-a little anxiously and intently.&#xD;

"My poor, pale little child I" he said-" you are nothing&#xD;
but a snowdrop this morning 1"&#xD;
"Well that is a very good thing to be," said Faith&#xD;
brightly. But the colour resemblance 'he had destroyed.&#xD;
She was lifted and carried down just as she had been&#xD;
carried up last night, and into the sitting-room again; for&#xD;
breakfast was prepared there this morning, and the sofa&#xD;
wheeled round to the side of the fire all ready for her.&#xD;
How bright the room looked !-..-.its red curtains within arid&#xD;
its~ white curtains without, and everything so noiseless and&#xD;
sweet 'and in order. Even the coffeepot was there by this&#xD;
time, and Mrs. Derrick arranged the cups and looked at&#xD;
Faith on the sofa, with eyes that lost no gladness when&#xD;
they went from her to the person who stood at her side.&#xD;
Faith's eyes fell, and for a moment she was very sober. It&#xD;
was only for a moment.&#xD;
"What a beautiful storm 1" she said. "I am glad it&#xD;
snows. I am going to do a great deal of work to-day."&#xD;
Mr. Linden looked at her. "Wouldn't you just as lieve&#xD;
be talked to sleep ?"&#xD;
She smiled. "You-couldn't---.do that, Mr~ Linden."~&#xD;
"Mr. Linden can do more than you think-and willy" he&#xD;
said with a little comic raising of the eyebrows.&#xD;
For a while after breakfast Faith sat alone, except&#xD;
as her mother came in and out to see that she wanted&#xD;
nothing,-alone in the soft snowy stillness, till Mr. Linden&#xD;
came in from the postoffice and sat down by her, laying&#xD;
against her cheek a soft little bunch of rosebuds and&#xD;
violets.&#xD;
"Faith," he said, "you have been looking sober-what&#xD;
is the reason ?"&#xD;
"I haven't been looking too sober, have I? I didn't&#xD;
know I was looking sober at all."&#xD;
She was loo1~ing quaint, and lovely; in the plain wrap-&#xD;
per she had put on and the soft thoughtful air and&#xD;
mien, in contrast with which the diamonds jumped and&#xD;
flashed with every motion of her hand. A stu~1y book lay&#xD;
in her lap.&#xD;
"How did all that, happen last night ?" said Mr. Linden&#xD;
abruptly.&#xD;
"Why !"-said Faith coloring and looking down at her&#xD;

ring...-." I was standing in the doorway and Nero was&#xD;
coming out with that great lamp; and when he got oppo-&#xD;
site the screen something fell on it, I believe, from the&#xD;
burning bookcases, and it was thrown over against him-I&#xD;
thought the lamp and he would all go over together-and&#xD;
I jumped ;-and in putting up my hand to the lamp I sup-&#xD;
pose, for I don't remember, the fluid must have run down&#xD;
my arm and on my shoulder-I don't know how it got on&#xD;
fire, but it must have been. from some of the burning wood&#xD;
that fell. The next I knew, you were carrying me to the&#xD;
drawing-room-I have a recollection of that."&#xD;
He listened with very grave eyes.&#xD;
"Were you trying to take the lamp from Nero ?"&#xD;
"0 no. I thought it was going to fall over."&#xD;
"What harm would it have done the floor ?"&#xD;
The tinge of colour on Faith's cheek deepened consider-&#xD;
ably, and her eyes lifted not themselves from the diamonds.&#xD;
She was not ready to speak.&#xD;
"I did not think of the floor".-.&#xD;
"Of what then ?"&#xD;
She waited again. "I was afraid some harm would be&#xD;
done,"&#xD;
"Did you prevent it?"&#xD;
"I don't know".-~--she said rather faintly.&#xD;
Gently her head was drawn down till it rested on his&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
"Faith," he said in his own low~sweet tones, "I stretched&#xD;
a little silken thread across the doorway to keep you out..-.&#xD;
did you make of that a clue to find your way in ?"&#xD;
She did not answer-nor stir.&#xD;
There were no more questions asked-no more words&#xD;
said; Mr. Linden was as silent as she and almost as still.&#xD;
Once or twice his lips touched her forehead, not just as&#xD;
they had ever done it before, Faith thought; but some&#xD;
little time had passed, when iie suddenly took up the book&#xD;
which lay in her lap and began the lesson at which it lay&#xD;
open; reading and explaining in a very gentle, steady&#xD;
voice, a little moved from its usual clearness. Still his&#xD;
arm did not release her. Faith listened, with a semi-&#xD;
divided mind, for some time; there was something in this&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8220-00000015"/>&#xD;
28&#xD;
&#xD;
state of things that she wished to mend. It came at last,&#xD;
when there was a pause in the lesson.&#xD;
"I am glad of all that happened last night," she said,&#xD;
'except the pain to you and mother. There is nothing to&#xD;
be sorry for. You shouldn't be sorry."&#xD;
"Why not, little naughty child ? -and why are you&#xD;
glad?"&#xD;
"Because-it was good for me,".-she said, not very&#xD;
readily nor explicitly.&#xD;
"In what way ?"&#xD;
"It was good for me,"-she repeated ;.-" it put me in&#xD;
mind of some things."&#xD;
LI Of what, dear child ?"&#xD;
It was a question evidently Faith would rather not have&#xD;
answered. She spoke with some difficulty.&#xD;
"That there are such things in the world as pain-and&#xD;
trouble. It is best not to forget it."&#xD;
Mr. Linden understood and felt; but he only answered,&#xD;
"It will be the business of my life to make you forget it.&#xD;
Now don't you think you ght to put up this book, and&#xD;
rest or sleep ?"&#xD;
"I dare say you on ht," said Faith,-" t~id I wish you&#xD;
would. I want to work."&#xD;
He gave her a laugh, by way of reply, and then gave&#xD;
her work as she desired; watching carefully against her&#xD;
tiring herself in any way, and making the lessons more of&#xD;
talk on his part and less of study on hers. They were&#xD;
none the less good for that, nor any the less pleasant. till&#xD;
there came a knock at the front door; and then with a littl~&#xD;
sigh Faith leaned back against the sofa, as if lessons were&#xD;
done.&#xD;
"There is Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"And I shall have to be on my good b&amp;amp;haviour," Mr.&#xD;
Linden said, quitting the sofa. "But I suppose he will&#xD;
not stay all the rest of the day." And as Cindy was slow&#xD;
in her movements, he went and opened the door; Faith the&#xD;
while fitting on a glove finger.&#xD;
"First in one element, and then in ano her-" Mr.&#xD;
Linden said, as the doctor caine in from a soit of sirnoon&#xD;
of snow.&#xD;
"This one for me I" said Dr. Harrison shaking hiic'&#xD;

self;-" but I should say you mast be out of your element&#xD;
to-day."&#xD;
"Wherefore, if you please ?" said Mr. Linden, as he&#xD;
endeavored to get the doctor out of his.&#xD;
"Unless you live in a variety! I thought you were in&#xD;
your element last night." And the doctor went forward&#xD;
into the sitting-room. The first move was to take a seat&#xD;
by Faith and attend to her; and his address and his in~&#xD;
quiries, with the manner of them, were perfect in their kind.&#xD;
interested, concerned, tender~, grateful, to the utmost limit&#xD;
of what might haze been in the circumstances testified by&#xD;
anybody, with equal grace and skill they were limited there.&#xD;
Of special individual interest he allowed no testimony to&#xD;
escape him-none at least that was unequivocal. And&#xD;
Faith gave him answers to all he said, ill he touched her&#xD;
gloved finger and inquired if the fire had been at work&#xD;
there too. Faith rather hastily dre it under cover anq&#xD;
said no.&#xD;
"What is the matter with it ?"&#xD;
"There is nothing had the matter with it," said Faith,&#xD;
very imprudently letting her cheeks get rosy. The doctor&#xD;
looked at her-told her he could cure her finger if she&#xD;
would let him; and then rose up and assumed his position&#xD;
before the fire, looking down at Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"There isn't much of a midge about you, after all," he&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"I suppose in the matter of wings we are about on a&#xD;
par. What is the extent of the damage ?"&#xD;
"It is nothing worth speaking of-I think now," said&#xD;
the doctor. "But we are ur~,der an extent of obligation to&#xD;
you, my dear fellow,-which sits on me as lightly as obli~&#xD;
nation so generously imposed should ;-~---and yet I should&#xD;
be doubly grateful if you could shew me some way in which&#xD;
I could-for a moment.-~.reverse the terms on which we&#xD;
stand towards each other."&#xD;
"I don't think of any generous imposition just now,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden smiling. "How are your father and&#xD;
sister ?-J was afraid they would suffer from the fright, if&#xD;
nothing else."&#xD;
"Strong nerves I" said the doctor shrugging his shoulders.&#xD;

chops done as much as usual. Sophy did suffer, though;&#xD;
but it was because Miss Faith would do nothing but get&#xD;
hurt in the house and wouldn't stay to be made well."&#xD;
"I am sure I did something more than that," said Faith,&#xD;
to whom the doctor had looked.&#xD;
"You don't deserve any thanks !" he said sitting down&#xD;
again beside her ;-" but there is somebody else that does,&#xD;
andy ~ wish you would give me a hint how to pay them.&#xD;
That young fellow who says he is no friend of yours-he&#xD;
helped us bravely last night. What can I do to please&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"Mr. Linden can tell best," said Faith looking to him.&#xD;
The doctor turned in the same direction.&#xD;
"Thank you !" Mr. Linden said, and the words were&#xD;
warmly spoken, yet not immediately followed up. "Thank&#xD;
you very much, doctor !" he repeated thoughtfully-" I am&#xD;
not sure that Reuben wants anything just now,..-.next sum~&#xD;
mer, perhaps, he may want books."&#xD;
"I see you are his friend ?"&#xD;
"Yes - if you give the word its full length and&#xD;
breadth."&#xD;
"What is that ?" said Dr. Harrison. "Don't go off to&#xD;
'Nought and All."'&#xD;
"II suppose in this case I may say, a mutual bond of&#xD;
trust, affection, and active good wishes."&#xD;
"There's something in that fellow, I judge ?"&#xD;
"You judge right."&#xD;
"A fisherman's son, I think you said. Well-I share&#xD;
the 'active good wishes,' at least, if I can't assume the&#xD;
'affection'-so think about my question, Linden, and I'll&#xD;
promise to back your thoughts. What do you do with&#xD;
yourself such a day? I was overcome with ennui-till I&#xD;
got out into the ~&#xD;
"Ennui is not one of my friends," said Mr. Linden&#xD;
smiling-" not even an acquaintance. In fact I never&#xD;
even set a chair for him, as the woman in Elia set a chair&#xD;
for the poor relation, saying, 'perhaps he will step in to-&#xD;
day'. I 'have been busy, doctor-what shalL I do to amuse&#xD;
you? will you have a foreign newspaper ?"&#xD;
The doctor looked dubious; then took the newspaper&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
and turned it over, but not as if he had. got rid of his&#xD;
ennui.&#xD;
"This smoke in the house will drive us out of Patta-&#xD;
quasset a little sooner than we expected."&#xD;
"Not this winter?"&#xD;
"Yes. That's nothing new-but we shall go a few&#xD;
days earlier than we meant. I wish you were going&#xD;
too."&#xD;
"When to return ?" said Mr. Linden. "I mean you-&#xD;
not myself."&#xD;
"I ?-J am a wandering cornet," said the doctor. "I&#xD;
have astonished Pattaquasset so long, it is time for me to&#xD;
flare up in some other place. I don't know, Linden.&#xD;
Somebody must be~ere occasionally, to overlook the re-&#xD;
fitting of the insid&amp;amp;oC that library-perhaps that agree.&#xD;
ble duty will fall on me. But Linden,".-said the doctor&#xD;
dropping the newspaper and turning half round on his&#xD;
chair, speaking gracefully and comically,-" you astonish&#xD;
Pattaquasset as much as I do; and to tell you the truth&#xD;
you astonish me sometimes a little. This is no place for&#xD;
you. Wouldn't you prefer a tutorship at Quilipeak, or a&#xD;
professor's chair in one of the city colleges? You may&#xD;
step into either berth presently, and at your pleasure,-I'&#xD;
know. .1 do not speak without knowledge."&#xD;
There was a stir of feeling in Mr. Linden's face-there&#xD;
was even an unwanted tinge of colour, but the firm~set lips&#xD;
gave no indication as to whence it came; and he presently&#xD;
looked up, answering the doctor in tones as graceful and&#xD;
more simple than his own.&#xD;
"Thank you, doctor, once more! But I have full em-&#xD;
ployment, and am-or am not-ambitious,----whichever way&#xD;
you choose to render it. Not to speak of the pleasure of&#xD;
astonishing Pattaquasset," he added, with a smile breaking&#xD;
out,-" I could not hope to do that for Quilipeak."&#xD;
"Please know," said the doctor, both frankly and with&#xD;
much respect in his manner, "that I have been so pre~&#xD;
sumptuous as to concern my mind about this for some time&#xD;
.-for which you will punish me as you think I deserve.&#xD;
flow to be so much further presumptuous as to speak to&#xD;

points of that 'friend' character which you were giving&#xD;
just now to Reuben Taylor-or to yourself, in his re-&#xD;
gard."&#xD;
"I am sure you .have them! But about Reuben,&#xD;
though I know reward is the last thing he thought of or&#xD;
would wish,-yet I, his friend, choose to answer for him,&#xD;
that if you choose to give him ~ny of the books that he&#xD;
will need in college, they will be ~eli bestowed."&#xD;
"In college!" said the doctor. ) "IDiable I Where is he&#xD;
going ?"&#xD;
Probably to Quilipeak."&#xD;
"You said, to college, man. J mean, what is college&#xD;
the road to, in the youngster's mind ?"&#xD;
"I am not sure that I have a right to tell you," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden,-" it is ~n~his mind a road to greater usefulness-.&#xD;
so much I may say.&#xD;
"He'll never be more useful than he was last night.&#xD;
However, I'm willing to help him try.-What is Mign-&#xD;
onette going to do with herself this afternoon ?".-said the&#xD;
doctor throwing aside his newspaper and standing before&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"I don't know," said Faith. "Sit here and work, I&#xD;
suppose."&#xD;
"I'll tell you what she ought to do," the doctor went on&#xD;
impressively. "She ought to do what the flowers do when&#xD;
the sun goes down,-.-.shut up her sweetness to herself, see&#xD;
and be seen by nobody, and cease 'to be conscious of her&#xD;
own existence."&#xD;
Faith laughed, in a way that gave doubtful promise of&#xD;
following the directions. The doctor stood looking down&#xD;
at her, took her hand and gallantly kissed it, and finally&#xD;
took himself off.&#xD;
"There is a good little trial of my patience I" Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den said. "I don't know but it is well he is going away,&#xD;
for I might forget myself some time, and bid him hands&#xD;
off."&#xD;
At which Faith looked thoughtful.&#xD;
"Faith," Mr. Linden said, gently  her face, "would&#xD;
you like to live at Quilipeak ?"&#xD;
The answer to that was a great rush of' colour, and a&#xD;

casting down of eyes and face too as soon as it was per-&#xD;
mitted.&#xD;
"Well ?" he said smiling-though she felt some other&#xD;
thread in the voice. '"What did you think of the words&#xD;
that passed between the doctor and me? Would you like&#xD;
to have me agree to his proposal ?"&#xD;
"You would do what is best," she said with a good deal&#xD;
of effort. "I couldn't wish anything else."&#xD;
ile answered her mutely at first, with a deep mingling&#xD;
of gravity and affection, as if she were very, very precious.&#xD;
"My dear little child I" he said, "if anything on earth&#xD;
could make me do it, it would be you !-.--and yet I can-&#xD;
not."&#xD;
She looked up inquiringly; but except by that look, she&#xD;
asked nothing.&#xD;
"You strengthen my hands more than you weaken&#xD;
them," he said. "I am so sure that you would feel with&#xD;
me !-...-I know it so well! I have a long story to tell you,&#xD;
dear Faitfl,-some time, not now," he added, with a sort&#xD;
of shadow coming over his face. "Will you let me choose&#xD;
my own time? I know it is asking a good deal."&#xD;
"It would be asking a great deal more of me to choose&#xD;
any other," Faith said with a sunny smile. "I like that&#xD;
time best."&#xD;
lie passed his hand softly once or twice across her fore-&#xD;
head, giving her a bright, grateful look, though a little bit.&#xD;
of a sigh came with it too,-then drew her arm within his&#xD;
and led her slowly up and down the room.&#xD;
But after dinner, and after one or two more lessons-&#xD;
under careful guardianship, Faith was persuaded to lay.&#xD;
herself on the sofa and rest, and listen,-.--first to various&#xD;
bits of reading, then to talk about some of her photographic&#xD;
pictures; the talk diverging right and left, into all sorts&#xD;
of paths, fictional, historic, sacred and profane. Then the&#xD;
light faded-the out-of-door light, still amid falling snow;&#xD;
and the firelight shone brighter and brighter; and Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick stopped listening, and went to the dining-room&#xD;
sofa for a nap. Then Mr. Linden, who had been sitting&#xD;
at Faith's side, changed his place so as to face her.&#xD;
"How do you feel to-night ?" he asked.&#xD;

"Perfectly well-and as nicely as possible. Just enough&#xD;
remains of last night to make it pleasant to lie still."&#xD;
~oup~e a real little sunbeam! Do you know I want&#xD;
yout~A off with me on a shining expedition ?'?&#xD;
"On what sort of expedition ?" said Faith laughing.&#xD;
"A shining one-I want to carry your bright face into&#xD;
all the darkest places I can find."&#xD;
There was an alternation of amusement and a grave ex-&#xD;
pression in her face for a minute, one and the other flitting&#xD;
by turns; but then she said quietly, "When, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"What shall I do with you ?" he said,-"shall I call you&#xD;
Miss Derrick ?"&#xD;
"No indeed !" she said coloring. "I don't often forget&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"No, I shall not do that, for it would punish myself too&#xD;
much, but I shall do something else-which will not punish&#xD;
me at all, and may perhaps make you remember. What&#xD;
do you suppose it will be?"&#xD;
"I don't know"-she said flushing all over.&#xD;
"Nothing worse than this".-he said, bending his face to&#xD;
hers. "Faith! I did not mean to frighten you so! I'll&#xD;
tell you where I want to take you-You know Monday is&#xD;
the first of January, and I want to go with you to those&#xD;
houses in the neighbourhood where the wheels of the new&#xD;
year drag a little, and try to give them a pleasant start.&#xD;
Would you like it ?"&#xD;
"0 !"-she said, springing forward with a delighted&#xD;
exclamation.-" Tell me, just what you mean. To which&#xD;
houses ?"&#xD;
"I mean that if you are well, we will have a long, long&#xD;
sleigh ride, and leave as many little pieces of comfort and&#xD;
pleasure by the way as we can. The houses, dear, will be&#xD;
more than you think-I must make out a list."&#xD;
Faith clapped her hands.&#xD;
"0 delicious! Tl~at is the best thing we could possibly&#xD;
do with Monday! and there are two days yet this week-&#xD;
I shall have plenty of chance, mother and I, to make e~very-&#xD;
thing. 0 what sorts of things shall we take? and What&#xD;
are some of the houses? There is Mrs. Dow, where we&#xD;
went that night,"-she said, her voice falling,-" and Sally&#xD;
Lowndes-what places are you thinking of ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I think we,~ight give Reuben at least a visit, if notriing&#xD;
else,-and there are a good many such houses down about&#xD;
those points, and fai~on along the shore. I was thinking&#xD;
most of them-though there are some nearer by. But my&#xD;
Mignopette must not tire herself,.-I did not mean to&#xD;
bring anything but pleasure upon her hands."&#xD;
"You can't! in this way," said Faith in deligl~ted eager-&#xD;
ness. "Who keeps house in Reuberf1's home? he has no&#xD;
mother."&#xD;
"No-I suppose I may say that he keeps house,.-.for&#xD;
his father is away a great deal, and Reuben always seems&#xD;
to be doing what there is to do. As to things-you will&#xD;
want some for well people, and some for sick,-at sonre&#xD;
houses the mere necessary bread and meat, and at others&#xD;
any of those little extras which people wl~o spend all their&#xD;
money for bread and meat can never get. But little ~&#xD;
Mr. Linden said smiling, "if I let you prepare, you must&#xD;
let me send home."&#xD;
"What?" said she. "I thought you said we would&#xD;
both take them together ?"&#xD;
He laughed-taking her hand and holding it in both his.&#xD;
"And so we will !.-..-I meant, send home here, to pre-&#xD;
pare."&#xD;
"Oh !-Well," said Faith, "but we have a great deal&#xD;
now, you know; and I can send Mr. Skip to get more.&#xD;
But one thing I know-we will take Reuben a roast&#xD;
turkey !"&#xD;
I wonder if she could tell, in the firelight, with what&#xD;
eyes he watched her and listened to he~r! Probably not,&#xD;
for his back was towards the fire, and the changing light&#xD;
and shade on his face was a little concealed. But the light&#xD;
had the mastery.&#xD;
"Faith," he said, "I shall send you home some sugar-&#xD;
plums-upon express condition that you are not to eat&#xD;
them up; being quite sweet enough already.&#xD;
His face, was so hid that probably Faith thought her own&#xD;
was hid too, and did not know how clearly its moved timid&#xD;
changes were seen. She leaned forward, and touching one&#xD;
hand lightly to his shoulder, said,&#xD;
"What do you mean to make me,-Endecott ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
It was a thing to hear, the soft fall and hesitancy of&#xD;
Faith's voice at the last word. Yet they hardly told of the&#xD;
struggle it had cost. How the word thrilled him she did&#xD;
not know,-the persons living from whom he ever had that&#xD;
name were now so few, that there was a strange mingling&#xD;
with the exquisite pleasure of hearing it from her lips,-a&#xD;
mingling of past grief and of present healing. He changed&#xD;
his place instantly; and taking possession of her, gave her&#xD;
the most gentle, tender, and silent thanks. Perhaps too&#xD;
much touched to speak-perhaps feeling sure that if he&#xD;
spoke at all it would be in just such words as she had so&#xD;
gently reproved. The answer at last was only a bright,&#xD;
"I told you. I could not promise-and I will not now I"&#xD;
She pushed her head round a little so that she could&#xD;
give a quick glance into his face, in which lay her answer.&#xD;
Her words, when she spoke, made something of a transition,&#xD;
which however was proved by the voice to be a transition&#xD;
in words only.&#xD;
"Wonldn't a bag of potatoes be a good thing for us to&#xD;
take ?"&#xD;
"Ceitainly I-and we must take some books, and some&#xD;
orders for wood. And you must have a basket of trifles to&#xD;
delight all the children we meet."&#xD;
"That's easy! And books, xviii you take? that's de-&#xD;
licious! that's better than anything, for those who can&#xD;
enjoy them, Do you think any of them want bibles ?"&#xD;
"We will take some, at a venture-I never like to go&#xD;
anywhere without that supply. And then we shall both&#xD;
have to use our wits to find out just what is wanted in a&#xD;
particular place,-the people that tell you most have often&#xD;
the least to tell. And above all, Faith, we shall want&#xD;
plenty of sympathy and kind words and patience,-they&#xD;
are more called for than anything else. Do you think you&#xD;
can conjure up a sufficient supply ?"&#xD;
"It is something I know so little about I" said Faith.&#xD;
"I have never had very much chance. When I went to&#xD;
see Mrs. Ousters I didn't in the least know how to speak&#xD;
to her. But these people where we are going all know&#xD;
you, I suppose ?"-she said-with another and not a little&#xD;
wistful look up into his face.&#xD;
"Most of them-more or less. What of it ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"That makes it easy," she said quietly. "But I suppose&#xD;
it would be just the same if you didn't know them! About&#xD;
the sick people,-Endecott---.if you can tell us how they are&#xD;
sick, mother and I between us can make out what things to&#xD;
prepare for them."&#xD;
" Did you think I was in earnest, dear Faith, when I&#xD;
asked about your sympathy ?" Mr. Linden said, drawing&#xD;
her closer.&#xD;
"No.-I think I have the sympathy, but I don't so well&#xD;
know how to shew it. Then loaves of bread, I suppose,&#xD;
wouldn't come amiss ?-And above all, meat. Where else&#xD;
do you think a roast turkey ought to go ?"&#xD;
"To one particular far-off house on the shore that is&#xD;
brim full of little childrcn.-..and nothing else I"&#xD;
"We'll take them a big one," said Faith smiling,-" and&#xD;
I suppose it is no matter how many cakes! You'll have&#xD;
to make a very particular list, with some notion of what&#xD;
would be best at each place; because in some houses they&#xD;
uldn't bear what in others they would be very glad 61'.&#xD;
Wouldn't that be good? So that we might be sure to&#xD;
have the right thing everywhere-one right thing, at any&#xD;
rate. The other things might take their chance."&#xD;
"Yes, I will do that. But you know the first thing is,&#xD;
that you should get well, and the next that you should not&#xD;
get tired,-and these must be secured, if nobody ever has&#xD;
anything."&#xD;
Faith's laugh was joyous.&#xD;
"To-morrow I mean to make cakes and pies," she stdd,&#xD;
~"and the next day I will bake bread and roast turkeys&#xD;
and boil beef! And you have no idea what a quantity of&#xD;
each will be wanted! I think I never saw anybody so&#xD;
good at talking people to sleep I-that didn't want to go.&#xD;
Now what is that ?" For the knocker of the front door&#xD;
sounded loudly again.&#xD;
"It is something to send people away-that don't want&#xD;
to go I" Mr. Linden said, as he ~ut her back in her old&#xD;
position on the cushions, and moved his chair to a respect~&#xD;
iul distance therefrom. But nothing worse came in this&#xD;
time than a note, well enveloped and sealed, which was for&#xD;
Mr. Linden. It ran after this fashion.-.--&#xD;

Mr. Linden read the hoVe by firelight and standing~&#xD;
then came and sat down by Faith and put it in her hands.&#xD;
By firelight Faith read it ha~tiIy, and looked up with eyes&#xD;
of great deli~ht. "Oh! "-she said, -"isn't that good !"&#xD;
Then she looked down at the note soberly again.&#xD;
"Well, little child? what ?" he said smiling. "Yes, I&#xD;
am very glad. What are you doubting about ?"&#xD;
"I am not doubting about anything," she said giving&#xD;
him the note,-" only thinking of this strange man."&#xD;
"Is he very strange ?" Mr. Linden said. But he did&#xD;
not pursue the subject, going back instead to the one they&#xD;
had been upon, to give her the information she had asked&#xD;
for about the sick people they were likely to meet in their&#xD;
rounds; passing gradually from that to other matters,&#xD;
thence into silence.. And Faith followed him, step by step,&#xD;

CHAPTER IJJ.&#xD;
7~HE next two days were busy ones, all round; for though&#xD;
I Faith was carefully watched, by both her guardians,&#xD;
yet she was really well and strong enough again to be&#xD;
allowed to do a good deal; especially with those intervals&#xD;
of rest and study which Mr. Linden managed for her. His&#xD;
work, between these intervals, took him often out of doors,&#xD;
and various were the tokens of that work which came&#xD;
home-greatly to Faith's interest and amusement. They&#xD;
were curiously indicative, too, both of the varied wants of&#xD;
the poor people in the neighbourhood, and of his knowledge&#xD;
on ~he subject. From a little pair of shoes which was to&#xD;
acco~n pany on&amp;amp; roast turkey, to the particular sort of new&#xD;
fishing net whi~h was to go with the other, it really seemed&#xD;
as if every sort of thing was wanted somewh~re,-simple&#xD;
things, and easy to get, and not costing much,-but price-&#xD;
less to people who had no money at all. Faith was ap-&#xD;
pointed receiver general, and her hands were full of amuse~&#xD;
ment as well as business. And those two things were the&#xD;
most of all that Mr. Linden suffered to come upon them,~&#xD;
whatever his own means might be, it was no part of his&#xD;
plan to trench' upon Mrs. Derrick's; though she on ijier&#xD;
part entered heart and hands into the work, with almost as&#xD;
much delight as Faith herself~ and would have given the&#xD;
two carte-blanche to take anything she had in the house.&#xD;
Faith didn't ask hi~m what she should take there, nor let&#xD;
him know much about it till Monday. By this time, what&#xD;
with direct and indirect modes of getting at the knowledge,&#xD;
Faith had become tolerably well acquainted with the class&#xD;
or classes of wants that were to be ministered to. Many&#xD;
were the ovenfuls that were baked that Friday and Satur-&#xD;
day! great service did the great pot that was used for&#xD;
boiling great joints! nice and comforting Were the broths&#xD;
and more delicate~ things provided, with infinite care for&#xD;
some four or five sick or infirm people. But Faith's delight&#xD;
was the things Mr. Linden sent home; every fresh arrival&#xD;

of which sent her to the kitchen with a new accession of&#xD;
zeal, sympathy, 'and exultation,.-sympathy with him and&#xD;
the poor people; exultation in the work-most of all in&#xD;
him! Great was the marvelling of Cindy and Mr. Skip at&#xD;
~hese days' proceedings.&#xD;
So passed Friday and Saturday; and Sunday brought a&#xD;
lull. Faith thought so, and felt so. Her roast turkeys and&#xD;
chickens were reposing in spicy readiness; her boiled meats&#xD;
and bakeries were all accomplished and in waiting; and&#xD;
dismissing all but a little joyful background thought of&#xD;
thenr, Faith gave her whole heart and mind to the full&#xD;
Sabbath rest, to the full Sabbath rising; and looked, in&#xD;
her deep happiness, as if she were-what she xvas-enjoy~&#xD;
ing the one and striving after the other. But the ways by&#xD;
which we are to find the good we must seek, are by no&#xD;
means always those of our own choosing.&#xD;
It was a clear, cold, still, winter's day. Cold enough by&#xD;
the thermometer; but so still that the walking to church&#xD;
was pleasant. They had c~me home from the afternoon&#xD;
service-Faith had not taken off her things-when she was&#xD;
called into the kitchen to receive a niessage. The next&#xD;
minute she was in the sitting-room and stood by the side&#xD;
of Mr. Linden's chair.&#xD;
"Mrs. Cutters is dying-and has sent for me."&#xD;
"For you, dear child ?-Well-.-.Are you able to go ?"&#xD;
"Oh yes."&#xD;
lie looked at her in silence, as if he were making up his&#xD;
own mind on the subject, then rose up and gently seating&#xD;
her on the sofa, told her to rest there till he was ready;&#xD;
but before he came back again Mrs. Derrick came to Faith's&#xD;
side with a smoking cup of chicken broth and a biscuit.&#xD;
"You've got to eat it, pretty child," she said fondly,-..&#xD;
"we're both agreed upon that point."&#xD;
Which joint mandate Faith did not try to dispute.&#xD;
The town clock had struck four, all counted, when Jerry&#xD;
dashed off from the door with the little sleigh behind him.&#xD;
No other sleigh-bells were abroad, and his rang out noisily&#xD;
and alone over the great waste of stillness as soon as they&#xD;
were quit of the village. The air happily was very still&#xD;
and the cold had not incre d; but low, low the sun was,&#xD;
and sent his slant beams cooll$~ over the snow-white fidds,&#xD;

glinting from fences and rocks and bares t4~icX'ets with &amp;amp;&#xD;
gleam that threatened he would not '~.t4hem long.&#xD;
The hour was one of extreme beauty,-fair an~ ~sfihl, with&#xD;
a steady strength in its stillness that made the beauty&#xD;
somewhat imposing. There was none of the yielding&#xD;
character of summer there; but a power that was doing&#xD;
its work and would do it straight through. "lie giveth&#xD;
forth his ice like morsels; who can stand before his cold ?"&#xD;
.-thought Faith.&#xD;
The sleighing was excellent; the roads in perfect con-&#xD;
dition.&#xD;
"How long is it since you were here ?" Mr. E den saId&#xD;
as the house came in sight, shewn only by its twinkling&#xD;
panes of glass.&#xD;
"Not since before I went to Pequot-.not since a day or&#xD;
two after that ride we took with Dr. Harrison, when you~&#xD;
j rode 'Stranger' the first time."&#xD;
"How was she then ?"&#xD;
"Not much different from what she had been before-..&#xD;
she didn't say much-she seemed to like to listen to me, or&#xD;
to see me, or both. That was all I could be sure of."&#xD;
"Try not to let her spend her strength in examining the&#xD;
pas~t state of her mind. Bid her lay hold of the promise&#xD;
now. A present hold will answer all her questions-and&#xD;
is all the oldest Christian can rest in."&#xD;
"I wish you could speak to her instead of me," said&#xD;
Faith. "Perhap~ she will let you."&#xD;
"It is not you nor I, my child.-Fix your heart upon&#xD;
Christ, and let him speak,.-flx your eyes upon him, and let&#xD;
his light shine."&#xD;
"I&#xD;
with know it. 0 I do !..-." she said, looking up at him&#xD;
an humble, moved face.&#xD;
He lifted her out of the sleigh and led her up to the&#xD;
house, where they were presently admitted; into an outer&#xD;
room first, xvhere Faith could lay off her furs.&#xD;
"She's some brighter to-night," the woman in attend-&#xD;
ance said, in answer to Mr. Liiiden's questions. "I guess&#xD;
she'll be real glad to see you"-this was addressed to&#xD;
Faith.&#xD;
Faith left Mr. Linden there, and went into the sick&#xD;
chamber alone; where she was always received as if she&#xD;

had brought an olive branch, or a palm branch, or both of&#xD;
them, in her hand. The spirit of both, no doubt, was in&#xD;
her; the gentle face looked the l)romise of both peace and&#xD;
victory, as only humility can look it~&#xD;
Mrs. Clusters on her part looked-as the other had said&#xD;
.-glad; if so bright a word could be applied to a face that&#xD;
had lost all its own light, and where no reflected light as&#xD;
yet shone. Yet she was quieter than when Faith had first&#xD;
seen her, whether from mental relief or physical prostra-&#xD;
tion, and was most eager for all Faith's words,-listeni~g&#xD;
for the most part in silence, but with eyes that nevei said&#xD;
'enough.' As some poor exhausted traVeller takes the&#xD;
water which he has at last reached in the desert, nor&#xD;
knows yet whether its bright drops can avail to~ save his&#xD;
life, but lays him down by the fountain-there to live or&#xD;
die. Ahd Faith, feeling that her hand was niinistering&#xD;
those drops of life, lost every other thought,~-~--except to&#xD;
wish for a hand that could do it better. Once she ventured&#xD;
a proposition.&#xD;
"I h~ve a friend here, Mrs. Clusters, who can tell you&#xD;
about all these things much better than I can. Will you&#xD;
let him? May I ask him to come in and see you ?"&#xD;
"Better ?" she said slowly-" I don't believe it. Who is&#xD;
he? your brother ?"&#xD;
"No-I haven't any brother. But that don't matter.&#xD;
He's somebody that is a great deal better than I am.&#xD;
May I let him come in? He's here," said Faith very qui-&#xD;
etly, along with her flushing cheek.&#xD;
There was a poor little faint smile for a moment upon&#xD;
the sick woman's lips while Faith spoke, but it passed and&#xD;
she answered in the same tone-" I'll see him-to please&#xD;
you-before you go. I just want the words now-and I&#xD;
like you best."&#xD;
Faith troubled her no more with unnecessary sugges-&#xD;
tions, and gave her 'the~' words.' Gave them with the&#xD;
fragrance of~ her own love about them, which certainly, is&#xD;
the surest human vehicle for the love above human that is&#xD;
in them. As on that first occasion, Faith placed herself&#xD;
on the side of the bed; and holding one of Mrs. Clusters'&#xD;
hands in her own, bending her soft quiet face towards the&#xD;
listening eyes and cars, she gave her one by rne, like&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                  43&#xD;
crumbs of life~giving food, the words of promise, ofencour-&#xD;
agement of invitation, of example. No answer cheered or&#xD;
helped her; no token of pleasure or even of assent met&#xD;
her; only those fixed listening eyes bade her go on, and&#xD;
told that whether for life and refreshment or no, the words&#xD;
were ~eagerly taken in, each after the other, as she said&#xD;
them. There was something in the strong sympathy of&#xD;
the speaker-in her own feeling and joy of the truths 'she&#xD;
told-that might give them double power and life to the&#xD;
ears ~f another. Faith reported the words of her Master&#xD;
with such triumphant pricing of them and such leaning on&#xD;
their strength; she gave his invitations in such tones of&#xD;
affection; she told over the instances of others' prevailing&#xD;
faith with such an evident, clear, satisfying share in the&#xD;
same ;-the living words this time lost nothing of their&#xD;
power by a dead utterance. Of her own words Faith&#xD;
ventured few; ~i ow and then the simplest addition to some~&#xD;
thing she had iiepeated, to make it more plain, or to carry&#xD;
it further home; such words as she could not keep back;&#xD;
such words, very much, as she would have spoken to&#xD;
Johnny Fax; not very unlike what Johnny Fax might&#xD;
have spoken to her. But there was not ~ little physical&#xD;
exhaustion about all this after a while, and Faith found&#xD;
she must have some help to her memory. She went into&#xD;
r room.&#xD;
[ the r~ant&#xD;
a bible?" she said looking round for it-" Is&#xD;
there one here ?"&#xD;
Yes, there was one, but it was Mr. Linden's. That was&#xD;
quickly given her.&#xD;
"I forgot it at the moment you went in," he said, "and&#xD;
then I did not like to disturb you. My dear Faith !-.."&#xD;
~ and he held her hand and looked at her a little wistfully.&#xD;
She brought her other hand upon his, and looked down&#xD;
and looked up wistfully too; like one with a heart full.&#xD;
"Can I help you? can I take your place ?"&#xD;
''She won't let you," said Faith shaking her head.&#xD;
She says she will see you by and by-but she must take&#xD;
her own time for it."&#xD;
And Faith went back to her ministrations. Of all bibles,&#xD;
she would have had that one in her hand then! And yet&#xD;
its companionship bowed down her heart with a sense of&#xD;

weakness ;-but that was the ve~'y position for the next&#xD;
move; a spring beyond weakness to the only real and sufli.&#xD;
dent ground of strength.&#xD;
The afternoon merged into the evening. A tallow can~&#xD;
die had been brought by the attendant intb the room in&#xD;
which Mr. Linden was waiting; and its dim smoky light&#xD;
would have made a dismal place of it if he had had no other&#xD;
to go by. lie could sometimes hear the low tones of a&#xD;
word or two in the other room; more often the tones were&#xD;
so low that they failed to reach him. When this state of&#xD;
things had lasted a long time-as it seemed.-therc came&#xD;
an interruption in the form of quick steps on the snow;&#xD;
then the door was pushed open, and Dr. Harrison ap..&#xD;
feared.&#xD;
"You here 1" was his astonished salutati6n. "What&#xD;
upon earth has brought you ?"&#xD;
"I came to bring some one else."&#xD;
"She isn't here ?" said the doctor. "You don't mean&#xD;
that ?"&#xD;
His emphatic pronouns were a little smile-provoking,&#xD;
in spite of the grave thoughts upon which they intruded-&#xD;
or~rather perhaps because of them; but if Mr. Linden's&#xD;
face felt that teYnptation, it was only for a moment,.-he&#xD;
answered quietly,&#xD;
"If you mean Miss Faith, she has been here a long&#xD;
time."&#xD;
The doctor knew that! if she came when she was called.&#xD;
fEe had stopped to eat his dinner.&#xD;
"1 mean her, of course," he said with his tone a little&#xD;
subdued. "I shouldn't 'think her mother would have let&#xD;
her come-such a night !-" Which ii~eant very plainly that&#xD;
Dr. Harrison would not have let her4-" Is she in there&#xD;
with the woman now&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
The doctor went with grave aspect to the door of com-&#xD;
munication between the two rooms and softly opened it and&#xD;
went in; so softly, that Faith, engaged in her reading, did&#xD;
no~ hear anything ~ the sick woman's eyes were the first&#xD;
that perceived him. Hers rested on him a moment-then&#xD;
came back to Faith, and then again met the doctor's; but&#xD;
&#xD;
not just a~ they had been wont. And her fi t words bore&#xD;
out his impression.&#xD;
"You may come in-..-" she said, slowly and disti&#xD;
"I'm not afraid of you to.~night."&#xD;
He came forward, looked at her, touched her hand,&#xD;
l~indl~; and then without a word turned to Faith.&#xD;
Faith did not dare ask a question, but her eyes put it&#xD;
silently.&#xD;
"She don't want anything," said he meaningly. "sot&#xD;
from me. She rn~y have anything she fancies to have."&#xD;
Faith's eyes went back to the. other face. That the&#xD;
doctor's words had been understood there too, was evident&#xD;
from the little flitting colour, and the sick woman' lay&#xD;
still with closed eyes, clasping Faith's hand as if she&#xD;
were holding herself back from drifting out on 'that great&#xD;
and unknown sea.' But she roused herself and spoke&#xD;
hurriedly. "Won't somebody pray for me ?"&#xD;
Faith bent over until her lips almost touched the suffer-&#xD;
er's cheek and her warm breath floated in the words, "I'll&#xD;
bring somebody-..-" then loosing her hold, she sprang from&#xD;
the bed and out into the other room. But when she had&#xD;
clasped Mr. Linden's hand, F~th bent down her head upon&#xD;
it, unable to speak. The strength it could, his hand gave&#xD;
her-and his voice.&#xD;
"What, my dear child ~&#xD;
~Then Faith looked up. "She wants you to pray for&#xD;
her." And without waiting for the unnecessary answer,&#xD;
she led Mr. Linden to the door of the room, there dropp~Td&#xD;
his hand and went in before him. Dr. harrison was&#xD;
standing by the bedpost, an~. looked wordlessly upon the&#xD;
two as they entered.&#xD;
Mrs. Ousters scanned the stranger's face as he came to~&#xD;
wards her, with an anxious, eager look, as if she wanted to&#xD;
know whether he could do anything for her; the look&#xD;
changing to one of satisfaction. But to his low-spoken&#xD;
question as he took her hand, she gave an answer that was&#xD;
almost startling in its slow earnestness.&#xD;
"Pray that I may believe-and that he may-and that&#xD;
God would bless her forever !"&#xD;
How was such a request to be met! then and there !~-.~&#xD;
for a moment Mr. Linden's eyes fell. But then he knelt&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8220-00000024"/>&#xD;
46                 SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
by her side, and met it most literally,-in tones very low&#xD;
and clear and distinct, in words that might have been&#xD;
angels' plumage for their soft bearing upward of the suffer-&#xD;
er's thoughts. Faith could feel a slight trembling once or&#xD;
twice of the hand that held hers, but the bitterness of its&#xD;
grasp had relaxed. Dr. Harrison was behind her;&#xD;
whether he stood or knelt she did not know; but he knew&#xD;
that when the other two rose to their feet, one of them was&#xD;
exceedingly pale; and his move, made on the instant, was&#xD;
to get her a glass of water. Faith only tasted it and gave&#xD;
it him back, and mounted to her former place on the bed.&#xD;
And for a little all was still, until Mr. Linden spoke again&#xD;
in the same clear, guiding tones.&#xD;
"'My God, within thy hand&#xD;
My helpless soul I trust!&#xD;
Thy love shall ever stand-.&#xD;
Thy promise must !.-'"&#xD;
Then Mrs. Custers opened her eyes; and her first look&#xD;
4~ras at iDr. Harrison. But whether the relaxed mental&#xD;
tension let the bodily weakness appear, or whether the tide&#xD;
was at that point where it ebbs most rapidly, her words&#xD;
were spoken with some trouble-yet spoken as if both to&#xD;
make amends and give information.&#xD;
"You meant to be very kind-" she said.-." and you&#xD;
have-But now I want to believe-even if it isn't any use."&#xD;
Her eyes passed from him-~rested for a minute on Mr.&#xD;
Linden-then came to Faith, and never~ wavered again.&#xD;
"iRead"-was all she said.&#xD;
With unnerved lip, and quivering breath Faith began&#xD;
again her sweet utterance of some of those sweetest things.&#xD;
For a moment she longed to ask the other two listeners to&#xD;
go away and leave her alone; but reasons, different and&#xD;
strong, kept her mouth from speaking the wish; and then,&#xD;
once dismissed; it was forgotten. Her voice steadied and&#xD;
grew clear presently its low, distinct words were not in~&#xD;
terrupted by so much as a breath in any part of the room.&#xD;
They steadied hor; Faith rested on them and clung to&#xD;
them as she went along, with a sense of failing energy&#xD;
which needed a stay somewhere. But her words did not&#xD;
chew it, except perhaps that they came more slowly and&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
47&#xD;
&#xD;
deliberately. Mr. Linden had ~drawn back a little out of&#xD;
sight. Dr. Harrison kept his stand by the bedpost, lean-&#xD;
ing against it; and whatever that reading was to him, he&#xD;
was as motionless as that whereon he leaned.&#xD;
Till some little length of time had passed in this way,&#xD;
and then he came to Faith's side and laid his hand on her&#xD;
open book.&#xD;
"She does not hear yon,~? he said softly.&#xD;
Faith looked at him startled, and then bent forward&#xD;
over the woman whose face was turned a little from her.&#xD;
"S he is sleeping"-she said looking up again.&#xD;
"She will not hear you any more/' said the doctor.&#xD;
"She breathes, regularly, "&#xD;
"Yes-so she will for perhaps some hours. But she will&#xD;
not waken again ,-probably."&#xD;
"Are you sure ?" Faith said with another look at the&#xD;
calm face before her.&#xD;
"Very sure!".-.&#xD;
Was it true? Faith looked still at the unconscious&#xD;
form,-then her bible fell from her hands and her h~ad&#xD;
wearily sunk~ into them. The strain was over-broken&#xD;
~short. She had done all she could,-.and the everlasting&#xD;
answer was sealed up from her. Those heavy eyelids&#xD;
would not enclose again to give it; those parted lips&#xD;
~ through which the slow breath went and came, would never&#xD;
~ tell her. It seemed to Faith that her heart lay on the&#xD;
very ground with the burden of all that weight resting&#xD;
it.&#xD;
~ pon&#xD;
She was not suffered to sit so long.&#xD;
"May J take you away ?".-Mr. Linden said~-"you&#xD;
must not stay any longer."&#xD;
"Do you think it is no use ?" said Faith looking up at&#xD;
him wearily.&#xD;
"It is of no use," said Dr. Harrison. He had come near,&#xD;
and took her hand, looking at her with a moved face in&#xD;
which there was something very like tender reproach.&#xD;
But he only brought her hand gravely to his lips again&#xD;
and turned away. Mr. Linden's ~words were very low-&#xD;
spoken. "I think the doctor is right.-.But let me take&#xD;
you home, and then I will come. back and stay till morning&#xD;

if you like-or till there comes a change. You must not&#xD;
stay."&#xD;
"I don't like to go,"-said Faith without moving. "She&#xD;
may want me again."&#xD;
"There may be no change all night," said the doctor ;-.&#xD;
"and when it comes it will not probably be a conscious&#xD;
change. If she awakes at all, it will only be to die. You&#xD;
could do nothing more."&#xD;
Faith saw that Mr. Linden thought so, and she gave it&#xD;
up; With a lingering unwillingness got off the bed and&#xD;
wrapped her furs round her. Mr. Linden put her into the&#xD;
sleigh, keeping Jerry back to let the doctor precede them;&#xD;
and when he was fairly in front, Faith was doubly wrapped&#xD;
up-as she had been the night of the fire, and could take&#xD;
the refreshment of the cool air, and rest. Very wearily,&#xD;
for a while, mind and body both drooped. Faith was as&#xD;
still as if she had been asleep; but her eyes were gazing&#xD;
out upon the snow, following the distant speck of the&#xD;
doctor's sleigh, or looking up to the eternal changeless&#xD;
lights that keep watch over this little world and mock its&#xD;
changes. Yet not so! but that bear their quiet witness&#xD;
that there is something .which is not "passing away ; "-yea,&#xD;
that there is something which "endureth forever."&#xD;
"He calleth them all by their names; for that he is&#xD;
strong in power, not one faileth." That was in Faith's&#xD;
mind along with other words-" The Lord knoweth them&#xD;
that are his." Her mind wa~ in a passive state; things&#xD;
floated in and floated out. It was some time before Mr.&#xD;
Linden said anything-he let her be as silent and still as&#xD;
she would; but at last he bent over her and spoke.&#xD;
"My Mignonette"-and the thought was not sweeter&#xD;
than the words-" are you asleep ?"&#xD;
"No-" she said in one of those ethereal answering tones&#xD;
which curiously say a great many things.&#xD;
"Are you resting ?"&#xD;
"Yes. I am rested."&#xD;
"You must try not to bear the burden of your work after&#xD;
it is done. Now lay it off-and leave your poor friend&#xD;
in the hands where I trust she has left herself.' Her senses&#xD;
are not closed to his voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I do"-she said with a grateful look. "IL know it is&#xD;
not my work-nor anybody's."&#xD;
He drew the furs up about her silently, arranging and&#xD;
adjusting them so as to keep oWthe wind which had risen&#xD;
a little.&#xD;
"We are not very far from home now,-~---we have come&#xD;
fast."&#xD;
And as Jerry did not relax his pace, the little distance&#xD;
was soon travelled over. How fair the lig~ii ts in their own&#xD;
windows looked then !-with their speech ~of blessing and&#xD;
comfort.&#xD;
They all came together round the fire first, and then&#xD;
round the tea-table; Faith being specially watched over&#xD;
and waited on by both the others. Mrs. Derrick's half&#xD;
developed fear at their long stay, had given place to a sort&#xD;
of moved, untalkative mood when she heard the explana.&#xD;
tion, but a mood which relieved itself by trying every pos.&#xD;
sible and impossible thing for Faith's refreshment. Every*&#xD;
possible thing except refreshing talk-and that Mr. Linden&#xD;
gave her. Talk which without jarring in the least upon&#xD;
the evening's work, yet led her thoughts a little off from&#xD;
the painful part of it. Talk of the Christian'~ work-of&#xD;
the Christian's privilege, of "Heaven and the way&#xD;
thither,"~of the gilding of the cross, of the glory of the&#xD;
crown. Faith heard and joined in it, but there was a&#xD;
point of pressure yet at her heart; and when they left the&#xD;
table and went into the other room, a slight thing gave&#xD;
indication where it lay. Faith. took a little bench by Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick's side, drew her mother's arms round her close, and&#xD;
laid her head down on her lap.&#xD;
How softly, how tenderly, did Mrs. Derrick answer the&#xD;
caress, as if she read ~t perfectly l-~--touching Faith's hands&#xD;
and brow and cheeks with fingers that were even trembling.&#xD;
And at last-whether her child's mute pleading was too&#xD;
much for her,-.-whether the pain which had never left her&#xD;
heart since the day of Faith's overturn had by degrees&#xD;
done its work,-she bent down her lips to I~afth's cheek&#xD;
and whispered-" Yes, pretty child-~I mean to try."&#xD;
And so. the door opened, and Cindy and Mr. Skip came&#xD;
in for prayers. Faith hid her face, but otherwise. did not&#xD;
stir.&#xD;

How sweet the service was to them all that night !-yes,&#xD;
to them all; there was not one ~vho could help feeling its&#xD;
influence. And yet it was very simple, and not very long,-&#xD;
Mr. Linden read first a fe*w Bible passages, and then Wes-&#xD;
ley's hymn of the New Year,-with its bugle note of ac-&#xD;
tion,-and then to prayer, for which, by that time, every&#xD;
heart was ready.&#xD;
"Come let ug anew our journey pursue,'&#xD;
Roll round with the year,&#xD;

His adorable will let us gkdly fulfil,&#xD;

Glides swiftly awny,&#xD;
And the fugitive moment refuses to stay.&#xD;
The arrow is flown-the moment is gone;&#xD;
The millennial year&#xD;
Bushes on to our view, and eternity's here.&#xD;

I have fought my way through;&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
THE first morning of the new year turned out as bright&#xD;
las could be desired for the great sleigh-riding expe~&#xD;
edition; the very day foi~ it. Mid in the very mood for it&#xD;
were the people wh~ were to go. Not but somewhat of&#xD;
last; night's gravity hung about Faith's bright face; the&#xD;
one did no hurt to the other; for the best brightness is&#xD;
always sure to be grave, and the best gravity is almost&#xD;
sure to be bright, on some side. However there was&#xD;
nothing contemplative about the character of things this&#xD;
morning; there was too much action afoot. Such an&#xD;
army of in eats and drinks, with all sorts of odd ends*~and&#xD;
varieties, from the shoes to the fishing-net, and such an&#xD;
array of apples and sugarpluins !--to marshal and order&#xD;
them all in proper companies and ranks, wanted a general!&#xD;
But Faith was by no means a bad general, and up to the&#xD;
act of stowing the sleigh, at which point the things were..~&#xD;
made over to Mr. Linden and Mr. Skip, her part was, well&#xD;
done. And Mr. Linden found in the course of his part&#xD;
of the business that Mrs. Derrick and Faith had followed a&#xD;
lead of their own.&#xD;
There had been a pretty packing and tying up and&#xD;
labelling at the table, before the sleigh-paqking began,-&#xD;
Faith's busy little fingers went in and~ ~out with great&#xD;
dexterity; and either Mr. Linden thought it was pleasant&#xD;
to her.-or knew it was pleasant to him, to have them so&#xD;
engaged; for though he stood by and talked to her, and&#xD;
laughed at her, he let the said little fingers have their way;&#xD;
except when they touched some harsh bit of string, or&#xD;
rough bit of paper, or unmanageable package, and then his&#xD;
own interfered. It was a bright packing up-without a&#xD;
shadow, at least that could be called such,, But once or&#xD;
twice, when with some quick movement of Faith's hand&#xD;
the diamonds flashed forth their weird light suddenly,-&#xD;
she did see that Mr. Linden's eyes went downr and that&#xD;
his mouth took a set which if not of pain, was at least sad.&#xD;
(51)&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8220-00000027"/>&#xD;
52              SAY AND SEAL.                                       SAY AND SEAL.              53&#xD;
&#xD;
It never lasted long-and the next look was always one&#xD;
of most full pleasure at her. But the second time, Faith's&#xD;
heart could hardly bear it. She guessed at the why and&#xD;
the what; but words were too gross a medium to convey&#xD;
from spirit to~ spirit the touch that love could give and&#xD;
pain bear. She watched her cWance; and when one of Mi'.&#xD;
Linden's hands was for a moment resting on a package&#xD;
that the other was busied in arranging, suddenly laying&#xD;
the jewelled ha'tid on his, Faith's lips kept it company.&#xD;
"Faith I" he said. And then as if he saw it all, he did&#xD;
not say another word, only held her for a minute in a very,&#xD;
very close embrace. But then he whispered,&#xD;
"Faith-...you must give me that in another way."&#xD;
Faith appeared to have exhausted her ammunition, for&#xD;
she only answered by hiding her face.&#xD;
"Faith"-Mr. Linden repeated.&#xD;
She looked up slowly, blushing all over; and her very&#xD;
doubtful face seemed to negative the whole proceeding.&#xD;
But then an irrepressible little laugh began to play.&#xD;
"I wouldn't do it," she said unsteadily,-"at least, I&#xD;
don't know that I would-if I hadn't wished so very&#xD;
much to give you something today ;-and I have nothing&#xD;
else !-."&#xD;
And serving herself desperately, Faith laid one hand on&#xD;
Mr. Linden's shoulder and slightly raising herself bn her&#xD;
toes, did bestow on his lips as dainty a kiss as ever Santa&#xD;
Claus brought in his box of New Year curiosities. But&#xD;
she was overcome with confusion the moment she bad done&#xD;
it, and would have rushed off if that had been possible.&#xD;
"Let me go".-she said hastily-"let me go !"-&#xD;
In answer to which, she was held as securely fast as she&#xD;
ever had been in her life. Covering and hiding all of her&#xD;
face that she could, Faith renewed her request, in a comical&#xD;
* tone of humility-as if she didn't deserve it.&#xD;
"I never felt less inclined to let you go !"&#xD;
"There is all that work to be done," said Faith, by way&#xD;
of possibly useful, suggestion.&#xD;
Mignonette, wilr you remember your new lesson ?"&#xD;
She whispered softly, "N6.-~--It was only Santa Claus."&#xD;
"Not Campaspe ?"&#xD;
"No-.Certainly not 1"&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
You remember," said Mr. Linden, "that when.~-' Cupid&#xD;
and Campaspe played at cards for kisses, C14!pid paid.'-.-.&#xD;
I was unavoidably reminded of that. But you may go on&#xD;
with your work,-you know what happens when lessons&#xD;
are learned imperfectly." And liberty for her work she&#xD;
had; no more.&#xD;
"Child," said her mother comin~~ in "a&#xD;
your lunch ?"                ~      re you ready for&#xD;
"Why no, mother," said Faith with a little laugh,-." of&#xD;
course not! but I can take it as I go on. There's a good&#xD;
deal of 'sorting' to do yet. I hope the sleigh is big."&#xD;
"Take it as you go on, indeed !" said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"You've got to stop and eat, chuld,-you can't live till&#xD;
night with nothing but other folk's dinners."&#xD;
Faith however declared she could not stop to eat; and&#xD;
she contrived to carry on both the rival, occupations to~&#xD;
gatherr, and even to make right sure that no one else&#xD;
should attempt to live upon anything more ethereal than&#xD;
sandwiches and pumpkin pie. She drank her coffee in the&#xD;
intervals of tying packages and writing labels, and ran&#xD;
about with a sandwich in one hand and a basket in the&#xD;
other; filling Mr. Linden's cup and putting tempting&#xD;
platefuls in his way. But he was as busy as she,-spend~&#xD;
ing much of his time at the barn, where Squire Stouten-&#xD;
burgh's pretty little box sleigh was in process of filling&#xD;
with cloaks, buffalo robes, and commodities! At last&#xD;
everything was in, and Mr. Linden came to announce that&#xD;
fact to Faith,-furs and hood were donned, and the &amp;amp;leigh&#xD;
was off with its whole load.&#xD;
Bright, bright the snow was, and blue the shadows, and&#xD;
fair the white expanse of hill and meadow, all crisp and&#xD;
sparkling. Everybody was out-which was not wonderful;&#xD;
but so well had Mr. Linden disposed and covered up his&#xD;
packages, that all anybody could see was that he and&#xD;
Faith were taking a sleigh~ride,-which was not wonderful&#xD;
either. And before long they left the more frequented&#xD;
roads, and turned down the lane that led, to ~he dwelling&#xD;
of Sally Loxvndes. How different it looked now, from that&#xD;
summer evening when Faith had gone there alone. What&#xD;
a coloring then lay on all the ground that was now white&#xD;
with sunlight and blue with shade!' And also, what a&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
difference in the mental coloring. But Jerry, travelling&#xD;
faster than her feet had done, soon brought them to the&#xD;
house. Mr. Linden buckled the tie, and helped Faith to&#xD;
emerge from the buffalo robes; the winter wind blowing&#xD;
fresh from the sea, and sweeping over the down till Jerry&#xD;
shook his blanket in disapproval.&#xD;
"Now my little counsellor," said Mi'. Linden, "what&#xD;
does your wisdom say should go in here-besides this&#xD;
basket of substantial? I think you know more of these&#xD;
people than I do ?"-And the surf in it~ cold monotony,&#xD;
said-'Anything warm!'&#xD;
"Mother has put in a shawl for Sally," said Faith,&#xD;
getting out the package ;-(it was one that Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
found she could do without,)-" and a little paper of tea,&#xD;
-tea is Sally's greatest deli ght,-.--here it is !"&#xD;
Sally's abode was in nothing different from the run of&#xD;
poor houses in the country; unpainted of course, outside&#xD;
and inside; a rag~. arpet on the floor, a gay patchwork&#xD;
coverlet on the be . Sally herself was in the rocking~&#xD;
chair before a little wood fire. But there was not the look&#xD;
of even poor comfort which may~ sometimes be seen; want,&#xD;
that told of lack of means and that also went deeper, was&#xD;
visible in everything.&#xD;
"I've come to wish you a happy ~iew year, Sally," said&#xD;
Faith brightly.&#xD;
"Laws! I wonder where it's to come from !" said Sally.&#xD;
"If within' would fetch it-I've wished it to myself till&#xD;
I'm tired. Happy new years don't come to all folks.&#xD;
Aint that-How do you do, sir 1-aint it the gentleman&#xD;
Jenny told of? that fell down at Mr. Simlins' door,?"&#xD;
"And got up again ?" said Mr. Linden. "Yes, I pre-&#xD;
sume I am the very person Jenny told of. I remember&#xD;
that Jenny was very kind to me, too. Where is she ?"&#xD;
"0 she's to Mr. Simlinses all along! she's got a good&#xD;
place; she knows when she~s comfortable. She dpn't think&#xD;
of me staying' here all alone."&#xD;
"B1t aren't you ~omfortable, Sally ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"I should like to know how I would be! Folks that is&#xD;
comfortable thinks all the wOrld is like them! If they&#xD;
didn't they'd help."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well what is the firs( thing that would help to make&#xD;
you comfortable ?" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
Sally looked at him, up and down.&#xD;
"I'd like to see a speck o' somebody's face now and then.&#xD;
I mope and mope, till I wish I'd die to get rid of it! You&#xD;
see, sir, I aint as I used to was; and my family aint numerous&#xD;
now. There's no one lives in this house over my head but&#xD;
me and a girl what stays by me to do chores. Aint that&#xD;
a life for a spider ?"&#xD;
Faith had been stealthily unfolding the shawl and now&#xD;
put it round Sally's shoulders. "Will that help to make&#xD;
you comfortable ?" she said gently.&#xD;
"Laws !" said Sally-.--" aint that smart! That's good as&#xD;
far as it goes. Where did that come from ?"&#xD;
"Mother sent it to you, for New Year."&#xD;
"It's real becoming of her !" said Sally in. a mollified&#xD;
tone, feeling of the shawl. "Well I won't say this New&#xD;
Years haint brought mc something."&#xD;
"It brings you too much cold air at present," Mr. Lin~&#xD;
den said. "Do you know that window lets in about as&#xD;
much cold as it keeps out ?"&#xD;
all" Well I reckon I do," said Sally. I've nothing' to do&#xD;
day but sit here and realize onto it. There aint no&#xD;
such a thing as building' a fire in the chimney that'll keep&#xD;
out the cold from that winder."&#xD;
I should think not !~.Lthe way is to attack the window&#xD;
itself:," he said, looking at it as, if he were studying the&#xD;
"We've brought you something else here, Sally, ~to help&#xD;
keep out the cold," said Faith. "May I put the things in&#xD;
your closet-so as to carry home my basket ?"&#xD;
"Yes, if you like. What have you got there, Faith ?"&#xD;
said Miss Lowndes looking into the closet after her.&#xD;
"There's a piece of beef, Sally, of mother's own curing-&#xD;
all ready cooked-....so you'll have nothing to do but cook&#xD;
your potatoes-and mother thought you'd like a few of our&#xD;
potatoes, they're good this year. Then here is a little&#xD;
paper of tea she sent you, and I've brought you one of my&#xD;
own pumpkin pies-so you must say it is good, Sally."&#xD;
"Well I'm beat 1" said Sally. "Haint you got something&#xD;
else ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
She was like to be beat on all hands; for Mr. Linden&#xD;
who had been examining the window while Faith emptied&#xD;
her basket., now went out and presently brought back ham-&#xD;
mer and nails and strips of lath, that made Faith wonder&#xD;
whether he had brought a tool-chest along. But the noise&#xD;
of his ham!ner was much more cheerful than the rattling&#xD;
9f the window, and when it had done its work outside as&#xD;
well as in, the wind might whistle for admission in vain~&#xD;
He came in and stood by the fire for a moment then, before&#xD;
they set oft; and asked Faith softly what else was wanted?&#xD;
And Faith whispered in answer-.-.&#xD;
"'The Dairyman's Daughter ?'-but you must give it."&#xD;
"Can't you get some comfort in reading your BiblQ&#xD;
Sally ?" said Faith while Mr. Linden went out tQ the&#xD;
sleigh with his hammer and nails."&#xD;
"Laws !" said Sally-" what's the use! I haint got the&#xD;
heart to take the trouble to read, half the time."&#xD;
"If you read one half the time, and pray too, Sally,&#xD;
you'll soon get heart for the other half."&#xD;
"It's easy talking' "-was Sally's encouraging view of the&#xD;
case.&#xD;
"It's a great deal easier doing," said Faith. "If you&#xD;
try it, Sally, it'll make you so glad you'll never say you&#xD;
want comfort again. ~&#xD;
"Well you've brought me a heap to-day anyhow," said&#xD;
Sally. "Just look at that winder! I declare !-L 'spect&#xD;
I'll make out to eat my dinner to-day without scolding."&#xD;
~ Mr. Linden came back with the tract, but kept it in his&#xD;
hand for a minute.&#xD;
"Do you know, Sally, how a house is built upon the&#xD;
bare ground ?" he said. "The mason lays down one stone,&#xD;
and then another on that; and if he cannot have his choice&#xD;
of stones he takes just what come to hand-little and big,&#xD;
putting in plenty of mortar to bind all together. Now&#xD;
that's the way you must build up a happy year for your-&#xD;
self,-and in that way every one can." The words were&#xD;
spoken very brightly, without a touch of faultfinding.&#xD;
"Well"-said Sally rocking herself back and.forth in the&#xD;
rocking-chair-.-" I 'spect you know how. "-Which might&#xD;
have been meant as a compliment, or as an excuse.&#xD;
"I think you do," said Mr. Linden smiling; "and I am&#xD;
&#xD;
going to leave you a true story of how it was really done&#xD;
by somebody else. Will you read it?"&#xD;
"Yes"-said Sally continuing to rock. "I'll do any-&#xD;
thing you ask me to-after that winders You've given me&#xD;
a good start-anyways. I'd as lives hear you talk as most&#xD;
things."&#xD;
There was not time fQr much more talk then, however.&#xD;
Mr. Linden and Faith went away, leaving the little book&#xD;
on the table. But when Sally went to take a nearer view&#xD;
of its words of golden example, there lay on it the first&#xD;
real little gold piece Sally had ever possessed.&#xD;
"That was a good beginning," said Faith in a sort of&#xD;
quiet glee, after she had got into the sleigh again. "I&#xD;
knew, before, we were like a butcher and baker setting oft'&#xD;
on their travels; but I had ~no idea there was a carpenter&#xD;
stowed away anywhere 1" And her laugh broke forth&#xD;
upon the air of those wild downs, as Jerry turned his head&#xD;
about.&#xD;
"I must be something, you know," said Mr. Linden,-..&#xD;
"and I don't choose to be the butcher-and certainly am&#xD;
not the baker."&#xD;
They turned into the village again, and then down&#xD;
towards the shore; getting brilliant glimpses of the Sound&#xD;
now and then, and a pretty keen breeze. But the sun was&#xD;
strong in its modifying power, and bright and happy&#xD;
spirits did the rest. One little pause the sleigh made at&#xD;
the house where Faith had had her decisive interview with&#xD;
Squire Deacon, but they did not get out there; only gave&#xD;
a selection of comforts into the hands of one of the house-&#xD;
hold, and jingled on their way shorewards. Not turning&#xD;
down to the bathing region, but taking a road that ran&#xD;
parallel with the Sound.&#xD;
"Do you remember our first walk down here, Faith ?"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden,.-." when you said you had showed me the&#xD;
"Well I did," said Faith smiling,--." I showed you what&#xD;
I knew; but you showed me what I had never known&#xD;
before."&#xD;
"I'm sure you showed me some things I had never&#xD;
known before," he said laughing a little. "Do you know&#xD;
where we ~re going now ?".--.they had left the beaten road,&#xD;

&#xD;
and entered a by-way where only footsteps marked the&#xD;
snow, and no sleigh before their own had broken ground.&#xD;
It seemed to be a sort of coast-way,--leading right off to-&#xD;
wards the dashing Sound and its low points and inlets.&#xD;
The shore was marked with ice as well as foam; the water&#xD;
looked dark and cold, with the white gulls soaring and dip-&#xD;
ping, and the white line of Long Island in the distance.&#xD;
"No, I don't know. Where are we going? 0 how&#xD;
beautiful! * 0 how beautiful I" Faith exclaimed. "Hasn't&#xD;
every time its own pleasure! Where are we going, Ende-&#xD;
cott ?"&#xD;
"To see one who Dr. Harrison 'fancies' may have 'some-&#xD;
thing in him.' Whatever made the doctor take such a dis-&#xD;
like to Reuben ?"&#xD;
Faith did not answer, and instead looked foi'ward with a&#xD;
sort of contemplative gravity upon her brow. Her cheeks&#xD;
were already so brilliant with riding in the fresh air that a&#xD;
little rise of colour could hardLy have been noticed.&#xD;
"Do you know ?"&#xD;
Faith presently replied that she supposed it w~s a dislike&#xD;
taken up without any sort of real ground.&#xD;
"XVell to tell you the truth, my little Mignonette," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden, "the doctor's twenty-five dollars gives me&#xD;
some trouble in that connexion. Reuben will take favors&#xD;
gladly from anybody that likes him, but towards people&#xD;
who do not (they are very few, indeed) he is as proud as&#xD;
if he had the Bank of England at his back. I might send&#xD;
him a dinner every day if I chose; but if Reuben were&#xD;
starving, his conscience would have a struggle with him&#xD;
before he would take bread from Di'. Harrison."&#xD;
Faith listened very seriously and her conclusion was&#xD;
a very earnest "Oh, I am sorry !-But then," she went on&#xD;
thoughtfully,~-" I dom't know that Dr. Harrison dislilces&#xD;
Reuben.-lle don't understand him, how should he ?Z&#xD;
and I know they have never seemed to get on well to-&#xD;
gether.-.--."&#xD;
"I chose to answer for him the other day," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden-" and I shall not let him refuse; but I have&#xD;
questioned whether I would tell him anything about the&#xD;
money till he is ready for the books. Then if he should&#xD;
meet the doctor, and the doctor should ask him !-"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Faith was silent a bit.&#xD;
"Bat Reuben will do what you tell him," ~he said.&#xD;
"And besides, Reuben was doing everything he could&#xD;
for Dr. Harrison the other night-he can't refuse to let&#xD;
Dr. harrison do something for him. I don't think he&#xD;
ought."'&#xD;
"lie had no thought of reward. Still, he would not&#xD;
refuse, ii~ he supposed any part of the 'doing' was out of&#xD;
care for him,-and you know I cannot tell him that I think&#xD;
it i~. *But I shall talk to him about it. Not to-day: I will&#xD;
not run the risk of spoiling his pleasure at the sight of us.&#xD;
There-do you see that little beaver-like hut on the next&#xD;
point ?-that is where he lives."&#xD;
Faith looked at it with curious interest. That little brown&#xD;
spot amidst the waste of snow and waters-that was where&#xD;
the fisherman's boy lived; and there ho was preparing him-&#xD;
self for college. And for what beside?&#xD;
"Will Reuben or his father be hurt at all at anything&#xD;
we have brought them ?" she said then.&#xD;
"No, they will take it all simply for what' it is,-a New.&#xD;
Year's gift. And Reuben would not dream of being hurt&#xD;
by anythi~ g we could do,-he is as humble as he is proud.&#xD;
We are like enough to find him alone."&#xD;
And so they found him. With an absorbed ignoring of&#xD;
sleigh-bells and curiosity--perhaps because the former'&#xD;
rarely came for him,-Reuben had sat still at his work&#xD;
until his visitors knocked at the low door. But then he&#xD;
came with a step and face ready to find Mr. Linden.-&#xD;
though not Faith; and his first flush of pleasure deepened&#xD;
with surprise and even a little embarrassment as he ushered&#xD;
her in. There was no false pride about it, but "Miss Faith"&#xD;
was looked upon by all the boys as a dainty thing; and&#xD;
Reuben placed a chair for her by the drift-wood fire, with&#xD;
as much feeling of the unfitness of surrounding circum-&#xD;
stances, as if she had been the Queen. Something in the&#xD;
hand that was laid on his shoulder brushed that away; and&#xD;
the4 Reuben looked and spoke as usual.&#xD;
Surrounding circumstances were not so bad~ after all.&#xD;
Faith had noticed how carefully and neatly the snow was&#xD;
cleared from the door and down to the water's edge, and&#xD;
everything within bore the same tokens. The room was&#xD;

very tiny, the floor bare -.but very clean; the blazing&#xD;
drift-wood the only adornment. Yet not so: for on an&#xD;
old sea chest which graced one side of the room, lay&#xD;
Reuben's work which they had interrupted. An open&#xD;
book, with one or two othei's beside it; and by them all,&#xD;
with mesh and netting-kneedle and twine, lay an old net&#xD;
which Reuben had been repairing. The drift-wood had&#xD;
stone supporters, -the winter wind swept in a sort of&#xD;
grasping way round the little hut; and the dashing of&#xD;
the Sound waters, and the sharp war of the floating ice,&#xD;
broke the stillness. But they were very glad eyes that&#xD;
Reuben lifted to Mr. Linden's face, and a very glad&#xD;
alacrity brought forward a little box for Faith to rest&#xD;
her feet.&#xD;
"Don't yoU mean to sit down, Mr. Linden ?" he said.&#xD;
"To be sure I do. But I haven't wished you a happy&#xD;
New Year yet.'~ And the lips that Reuben most reverenced&#xD;
in the world, left their greeting on his forehead. It was&#xD;
well the boy found something to do-.with the fire, and&#xD;
Faith's box, and Mr. Linden's chair! But then ho stood&#xD;
silent and quiet as before.&#xD;
"Don't you mean to sit down, Reuben ?" said aith.&#xD;
Reuben siniled,-not as if he caved about a sea ; but he&#xD;
brought forward another little box, not even the first cousin&#xD;
of Faith's7 and sat down as she desired.&#xD;
"Didn't you find it very cold, Miss Faith ?" he said, as&#xD;
if he could not get used to seeing her there. "Are you&#xD;
getting warm now&#xD;
Faith said she hadn't been cold; and would fast enough&#xD;
have entered into conversation with Reuben, but she thought&#xD;
he would rather hear words from other lips, and was sure&#xD;
that other lips could give them better.&#xD;
"And have you got quite well, ma'am ~ said Reuben.&#xD;
"Don't I look well ?" she said smiling at him. "What&#xD;
are you doing over there, Reuben ?-making a net ?"&#xD;
"0 I was mending it, Miss Faith."&#xD;
"I can't afford to have you at that work just now," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden,-"y~u know we begin school again to-mor-&#xD;
row. You must tell your father from me, Reuben, that ho&#xD;
must please to use his new one for the present, and let you&#xD;
mend up that at your leisure. Will you ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Reuben flushed-looking up and then down as he said,&#xD;
"Yes, sir," and then very softly, "0 Mr. Linden, you&#xD;
needn't have done that !"&#xD;
"Of course I need not-people never need please them.&#xD;
selves, I suppose. But you know, Reuben, there is a great&#xD;
dear of Santa Claus work going on at this time of year,&#xD;
and Miss Faith and I have had some of it put in our hands.&#xD;
I won't answer for what she'll do with you !-..but you must&#xD;
try and bear it manfully."&#xD;
Reuben laughed a little half in sympathy with the&#xD;
bright words and smile, half as if the spirit of the time&#xD;
had laid ho'ld of him.&#xD;
"You know, Mr. Linden," said Faith laughing, but ap-&#xD;
pealingly too,-"that Reuben will get worse handling from.&#xD;
you than he will from me! so let him have the worst&#xD;
first."&#xD;
"I'll bring in your basket," was all he said,-and the&#xD;
basket came in accordingly; Reuben feeling too bewildered&#xD;
to even offer his services.&#xD;
Faith found kierself in a corner. She jumped up and&#xD;
placed herself in front of the basket so as to hide it.&#xD;
"Wait !"-she said. "Reuben, h~w much of a housekeej~r&#xD;
are you ?"&#xD;
"I don't know, Miss Faith,-I don't believe I ever was&#xD;
tried."&#xD;
"Do you know how to make mince pies, for instance ?"&#xD;
But Reuben shook his~ head, with a low-spoken, "No,&#xD;
Miss Faith, "-a little as if she were somehow transparent7&#xD;
and he was viewing the basket behind her.&#xD;
"Nevei~ mind my questions," said Faith, "but tell me.&#xD;
Could you stuI~, a tui'key, do you think, if you tried ?"&#xD;
"I suppose I could-somehow," Reuben said, coloring&#xD;
and Laughing. "I never tried, Mis~ Faith."&#xD;
"Then you couldn't !" said Faith, her laugh rolling&#xD;
round the little room, as softly as the curls of smoke went&#xD;
up the chimney. "You needn't think you could! But&#xD;
Reuben, since you can't, don't you think you would let me&#xD;
do it once for you ?"&#xD;
Reuben's words were not ready in answer. But a&#xD;
bashful look at Faith's face-and her hands,..-one that&#xD;
reminded her of the clam-roasting,-was followed by a&#xD;

grateful, low-s keii~-"T don't think you ought to do any.&#xD;
"I have had so much'~ileasure in it, Reuben, you'll have&#xD;
to forgive me ;"-Faith answered, withdrawing from the&#xD;
basket.'&#xD;
"lou must look into that at your leisure, Reuben," Mr.&#xD;
Linden said, ~as he watched the play of feeling in the boy~&#xD;
face. "Miss Faith is in no hurry for her basket."&#xD;
Reuben heard him silently, and as silently lifted the&#xD;
basket from where it stood and set it carefully on the table.&#xD;
But then he came close up to Faith and stood by her side.&#xD;
"You are 'very good, Miss Faith !" he said. "I don't know&#xD;
how to thank you."&#xD;
"Reuben !" said Faith colouring-."you mustn't thank&#xD;
me at all. I've just had the pleasure of doing-but it is&#xD;
Mr. Linden that has brought the basket here, and me&#xD;
too."&#xD;
"And he must tal~ you away," Mr. Linden said.&#xD;
"Reuben, you may thank Miss Faith just as much as you&#xD;
please. If I had nothing else to do, I should invite my-&#xD;
self here to dinner, but as it is I must be off. Are you&#xD;
ready ?" he said to Faith, while in silence Reuben knelt&#xD;
down to put on again the moccasins which she had thrown&#xD;
oft', and then she followed Mr. Linden. Reuben followed&#xD;
too,-partly to help their arrangements, partly at Mr.&#xD;
Linden's bidding to bring back the net. But when there&#xD;
was added thereto a little package which could only mean&#xD;
books, Reuben's cup of gravity, at least, was full; and&#xD;
words of good-bye he had none.&#xD;
And for a few minutes after they drove away Faith too'&#xD;
was silent with great pleasure. She hardly knew, though&#xD;
s1~e felt, how bright the sun was on the snow, and how&#xD;
genial his middayy winter beams; and with how crisp a&#xD;
gi earn the light broke on ice points and crests of foam and&#xD;
glanced from the snow-banks. The riches of many days&#xD;
seemed crowded into the few hours of that morning. Were&#xD;
they not on a " shining" expedition! Had they not been&#xD;
leaving sunbeams of gladness in house after house, that&#xD;
would shine, on, nobody knew how long! Faith was too&#xD;
glad for a little while not to feel very sober; those sun-&#xD;
beams came from so high a source, and were wrought In&#xD;

SAY AND SEAL.             Os&#xD;

with others that so wrapped. her own life about. So she&#xD;
looked at Jerry's ears and said nothing.&#xD;
"Faith," Mr. Linden said suddenly, "I wish II could&#xD;
tell you what it is to me to be going these rounds with&#xD;
Faith showed a quick, touched little smile. "I've been&#xD;
thinking just now,~.-what it means."&#xD;
"I should like to have the explanation of those last&#xD;
three words. '~&#xD;
"What it means ?"-.-.and the slight play of her lips did&#xD;
not at all hinder the deep, deep strength of her thought&#xD;
from being manifest.-" It means, all you have taught me&#xD;
and led me to !-."&#xD;
" You don't intend to lead me to a very clear understand&#xD;
ing," he said playfully, and yet with a tone that half&#xD;
acknowledged her meaning. "Do you ever remember&#xD;
what you have taught me ?-.They say one should at the&#xD;
end of the year, reckon up all the blessings it has brought,&#xD;
..-.but I know not where to begin, nor how to recount&#xD;
them. This year !-it has been like th~ shield in the old&#xD;
fable,-it seemed to me of iron to look forward to-so cold&#xD;
and dark,-and it has been all gold!"&#xD;
"Did it look so ?" she said with quick eyes of sym-&#xD;
pathy.&#xD;
"Yes, little Sunbeam, it looked so; and there were&#xD;
enough earthly reasons why it should. But unbelief has&#xD;
had a rebuke for once ;-if J know myself; I am ready now&#xD;
to go forward without a question !"&#xD;
Over what lull Difficulty did that future road lie ?-.---I{e&#xD;
did not explain, and the next words came with a different&#xD;
tone,-one that almost put the other out ~f Faith's head.&#xD;
"My little Sunbeam, do you keep warm&#xD;
"Yes"-she said with a somewhat wistful look that came&#xD;
from a sunbeam determined upon doing its very best of&#xD;
shining, for him. But she was silent again for a minute.&#xD;
"There are plenty of sunbeams abroad to-day, Endecott,"&#xD;
she said then with rare sweetness of tone, that touched&#xD;
but did not press upon his tone of a few minutes ago.&#xD;
"Dear Faith," he said looking at her, and answering the&#xD;
wistfulness and the smile and the voice all in one,-" do&#xD;

you ?-And do you know that I think there was never&#xD;
such a New Year's day heard of ?.-it is all sunshine! Just&#xD;
look how the light is breaking out there upon the ice, arid&#xD;
touching the waves, and shining through that one little&#xD;
cloud,-and guess how I feel it in my heart. Do you&#xD;
know how much work of this sort, and of every sort,&#xD;
you and I shall have to do together, little child, if we&#xD;
live ?"&#xD;
It was a look of beauty that answered,.-so full in its&#xD;
happiness, so blushing and shy; but Faith's words were&#xD;
as simple as they were earnest.&#xD;
".1 wish it. There can't be too much."&#xD;
Their course now became rather irregular; crossing about&#xD;
from one spot to another, and through a part of the country&#xD;
where Faith had never been. ilere was a sort of shore&#xD;
population,.-.people living upon rocks and sand rent free,&#xD;
or almost that; and supporting themselves otherwise as best&#xD;
they might. A scattered, loose-built hamlet, perching along&#xD;
the icy shore, and with its wild winds to rock the children&#xD;
to sleep, and the music of the waves for a lullaby. But the&#xD;
children throve with such nursing, if one might judge by the&#xD;
numbers that tumbled in the snow and clustered on the&#xD;
doorsteps; and the am~spment they afforded Faith was&#xD;
noVsmall. The houses weLre too many here to have time&#xD;
for a visit to each,.-a pause at the door, and the leaving&#xD;
of some little token of kindness, was all that could be at-&#xD;
tempted; and the tokens were various. I~aith's loaves of&#xD;
bread, and her pieces of meat, or papers from the stock of&#xD;
tea and sugar with which she had been furnished, or a bowl&#xD;
of broth jelly for some sick person,-a pair of woollen&#xD;
stockings, perhaps, or a flannel jacket, for some rheumatic&#xD;
old man or woman,-or a bible,-or a combination of dif.&#xD;
fervent things where the need demanded. But Faith's special&#xD;
~fun was with the children.&#xD;
When they first entered the hamlet, Mr. Linden brought&#xD;
forward and set at her feet one basket of trifling juvenile&#xD;
treasures, and another filled more substantially with apples&#xD;
and cakes and sugarplums; and then as all the children&#xD;
were out of doors, he drove slowly and let her delight as&#xD;
many of them as she chose. What pleasure it was !.-those&#xD;
little cold hands, so unwanted to cakes and that could&#xD;
&#xD;
~AX A~NV bI~AJ4.              05&#xD;
hardly hdd apples,-how eagerly, how shyly, they were&#xD;
street Led out !-with what flourishes of bare feet or old&#xD;
shoes the young ones scampered away, or stood gazing'&#xD;
after Jerry's little dust-cloud of snow ;-ever after to re~&#xD;
member and tell of this day, as one wherein a beautiful&#xD;
lady dressed up like a pussy cat, gave them an apple, or a&#xD;
stick of candy, or a picture book! Faith was in a debate&#xD;
between smiles and tears by the time they were through the&#xD;
hamlet and dashing out again on the~open snow, for Mr.&#xD;
Linden had left all that part of the business to her; though&#xD;
the children all seemed to know him-and he them-by&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
And good note Faith took of that, and laid up the&#xD;
lesson. She had been a very good Santa Claus the while,&#xD;
and had acted the part of a sunbeam indifferent well; being&#xD;
just about so bright and so soft in all her dealings with&#xD;
those same little cold hands and quick spirits; giving them&#xD;
their apples and candy with a good envelope of gentle&#xD;
words and laughter. Seeing that she had it to do, she&#xD;
went into the game thoroughly. But once she made a&#xD;
private protest.&#xD;
"Do you know, Endecott, these things would taste a&#xD;
great deal sweeter if your hand gave them ?"&#xD;
"I know nothing of the sort! Sweeter ?-look at that&#xD;
urchin deep in peppermint candy,-.-.could anything enhance&#xD;
the spice or the sweetness of that ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Faith shaking her head-." and look at that&#xD;
little girl before him who took the apple and looked at you&#xD;
all the while!"&#xD;
"She has an eye for contrast," he said laughing,&#xD;
"and is probably wondering why all people can't look&#xD;
alike !"&#xD;
Faith did not secretly blame her, but she left that&#xD;
subject.&#xD;
It was to the furthest point of their round that they went&#xD;
another fisherman's ho~ise-far, far oft; on the shore.&#xD;
A little larger than Reuben's, but not so neatly kept; as&#xD;
indeed how could it be? with so many children,-or how&#xD;
could the house hold them, in those times of weather when&#xD;
they condescended to stay in! They were in pretty good&#xD;
Qrdor1 to do their mother justice, and she in great delight&#xD;

at the sight of her visitors. There was no room for silence&#xD;
here-or at least no silence in th~ room, for Mrs. Ling was&#xD;
never at a loss for words. And there was no need of much&#xD;
circumlocution in presenting the turkey, -nothing but&#xD;
pleasure could come of it, let it enter on which foot it&#xD;
would; and the train of potatoes, and tea, and bread, and&#xD;
other things, fairly made Mrs. Ling's eyes shine,-though&#xD;
she talked away as fast as ever. The children were in&#xD;
spirits too great to be got rid of in any ordinary way,&#xD;
especially the youngest walking Ling; whose turn having&#xD;
not yet come for a pair of shoes from his father's pocket,&#xD;
was now to be fitted out of Mr. Linden's sleigh. And the&#xD;
shoes did fit-and little Japhet marked his sense of the&#xD;
obligation by at once requesting Faith to tie them. Which&#xD;
Faith did in a state of delight too great for words.&#xD;
U Now what do you. feel like ?" she said, when Japhet&#xD;
was fairly shod and she still stooping at his feet.&#xD;
"I feel like a king!" said Japhet promptly7 - which&#xD;
had been the height of his republican ambition for sonic&#xD;
time.&#xD;
"Dear sakes !" said his mother, who had heard the child's&#xD;
request too late to interfere,.-" I hope you'll not mind him,&#xD;
ma'am,-he oughter know better, but he don't. And poor&#xD;
things, when they gets pleased.-.it aint often, you see,&#xD;
ma'am, so I can't be hard upon 'em. Do you feel warm?&#xD;
s-we do make out to keep warm, most times."&#xD;
"I am quite warm, thank you; but I should think you'd&#xD;
feel the wind down here. Japhet,"-said Faith, who had&#xD;
brought in her basket of varieties and whose quiet eyes&#xD;
were fairly in a dance with fun and delight,-" which do&#xD;
you think kings ~ike best-cookies or candy ?"&#xD;
To which Japhet with equal promptness replied,&#xD;
"Candy-and cookies."&#xD;
"Don't !"-his mother said again,-but the basket of&#xD;
varieties looked almost as wonderful to her eyes as to those&#xD;
of the children, who now gathered round as near as they&#xD;
dare come, while Mrs. Ling cautiously peeped over their&#xD;
heads.&#xD;
"I see you feel like a king !" said Faith filling both&#xD;
Japhet's hands.-.--A' There! now I hope you don't feel like&#xD;
Alexander."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Alexander haint got nothing' !" said Japhet~ looking&#xD;
towards his eldest brother.&#xD;
Which did not overset Faith's gravity, because by this&#xD;
time she had none to speak of. Alexander's delight was&#xD;
found to be in red apples, and he thought a little common&#xD;
to~ a treastAre such as neither Diogenes nor the real Alex-&#xD;
ander knew of between them! One little girl was made&#xD;
happy with a wonderful picture-book in which there were&#xD;
a dog, a cat, and a lion with a great mane just ready to eat&#xD;
a man up, with the stories thereto pertaining; and a neat&#xD;
little slate seemed a most desirable acquisition to the bright&#xD;
eyes of an older girl. They were al4~ more satisfied than&#xD;
the conqueror of the world by the time Faith rose from the&#xD;
basket; and then she offered her tribute of gingerbread to&#xD;
Mrs. Ling. The little girl with the slate, once released&#xD;
from the spell of the basket, went up to Mr. Linden (who&#xD;
had stood looking on) and said,~-" She's awake now, if&#xD;
you please, sir,"-and he turned and went into the next&#xD;
room, leaving Mrs. Ling to entertain Faith as best she&#xD;
might. For whichMrs. Ling was most ready.&#xD;
"Ma always does want to see him"-she said. "You&#xD;
see, ma'am, she can't never get up now, so it's a play to&#xD;
hear somebody talk. And ma likes ihui special. Mr.&#xD;
Somers he's been kind too - and Mrs. - he come down&#xD;
when ma was first took, and since; but someways she don't&#xD;
just see into him much. I don' know but it's along of his&#xD;
bein' better than other folks-but after all, a person wants&#xD;
to have even good things talked to 'em so's they can under-&#xD;
stand. Now Mr. Linden,-my Mary there '11 listen to him&#xD;
for an hour, and never lose a word." And Mary's bright&#xD;
little eyes answered that readily, while Mrs. Ling's went&#xD;
back to the basket.&#xD;
"I can't believejP'~she said. "You don't know what&#xD;
you've done, ma'am! Why there aint one o' them children&#xD;
as ever see a real live turkey cooked, in their existence."&#xD;
"You don't knoW' what pleasure I had in doing it for&#xD;
them, Mrs. Ling. Mr. Linden tld me there was a house.&#xD;
ful of children."&#xD;
"Well so there is !" said Mrs. Ling looking round the&#xD;
room,-" and it's no wonder he thinks so, for they tease&#xD;
him most out of his life sometimes when he's here,-.-or&#xD;

would if he wasn't as good~-natured as~' the day's long. But&#xD;
there aint one too many, after all said and done, for I've&#xD;
got nothing else,.-so if it wasn't for them I should be&#xD;
poorly offi" With which reverse statement of the case,&#xD;
Mrs. Ling complacently smoothed down four, or five heads,&#xD;
and tied as many aprons.&#xD;
"Ma,~' said little Mary, "will Mr. Linden sing for us to-&#xD;
day?"&#xD;
"I dare say.-if you ask him pretty," 'said her mother.&#xD;
"No, I guess he's busy and won't be bothered."&#xD;
"He never is bothered," said Mary persistently, while&#xD;
two or three of the others recovering from their apples and&#xD;
shyness, ventured up to Faith again and began to stroke&#xD;
her furs.&#xD;
"What dQes he sing for you, Jenny ?" said Faith, taking&#xD;
the little picture-book girl on her lap, and glad to put her&#xD;
own face down in a somewhat sheltered position.&#xD;
"0 he sings hymns-" said Jenny, gazing abstractedly&#xD;
at the lion and the cat by turns,-" and other things too,&#xD;
sometimes."&#xD;
"Hymns are very interesting. And beautiful-don't&#xD;
you think so ?" said Mary drawing nearer.&#xD;
"Yes, indeed I do," said Faith stretching out her hand&#xD;
and pulling the little girl up to her. "What ones' do ~u&#xD;
like best, Mary?"&#xD;
But Mary's answer stayed, for Mr. Linden came back at&#xD;
that moment, and skilfully making his way up to Faith&#xD;
without running over any of the little throng, he told her&#xD;
he was ready. And Faith, though secretly# wishing for the&#xD;
song as much as any of the children, set Jenny on the floor&#xD;
and rose up ~ while Mr. Lind~n laugh ugly showed her 'an&#xD;
excellent way of investing ten cents', by giving the children&#xD;
each one. Meanwhile Mrs. Ling had been emptying the&#xD;
basket. There was the cold turkey in the full splendour&#xD;
of its rich brown coat-a good large turkey too; but lest&#xD;
there should not be enough of it to go round to so many&#xD;
mouths, Mrs. Derrick and Faith had added a nice piece,&#xD;
ready boiled, of salt pork. Then there were potatoes,&#xD;
and some of Faith's bread,-and a paper of tea and&#xD;
another of sugar; and there was arrowroot, made and uii-&#xD;
made, for the sick woman, with some broth jelly. It was&#xD;
&#xD;
one of those houses where a good deal was wanted, and&#xD;
the supply had been generous in proportion. Mrs. Ling&#xD;
was at her wits' end to dispose of it all; and the children&#xD;
watched her in a gale of excitement, till the last thing was&#xD;
carried off, and Mrs. Ling began to shake out the napkins&#xD;
and' fold them up. But then they came round Mr. Linden&#xD;
with their petition, urging it with such~ humble pertinacity,&#xD;
that he was fain at last to comply. It was only a child's&#xD;
Christmas hymn, set to a simple, bright, quick tune, which&#xD;
at first kept sonic of the smallest feet in a greater state of&#xD;
unrest than the older children thought at all respectful.&#xD;
"0 little children, sing.&#xD;
Jesus, your Lord and King&#xD;
For you a child became:&#xD;
On that bright Christmas day&#xD;
He in a manger lay,&#xD;
Who hath the one Almighty name!&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Come children, love him now,&#xD;
Before the Saviour bow,&#xD;
Give him each little heart.&#xD;
His spotless nature see,--&#xD;
Then like him spotless be,&#xD;
And choose his service for your part.&#xD;
"The joy of loving him&#xD;
Shall ever fade nor dim,-&#xD;
W ile worldly joys fly fast&#xD;
Jesu to see and love,&#xD;
First here and then above,&#xD;
Such joy s all ever, ever last.&#xD;
"I'll give myself away&#xD;
On this new Christmas day,-&#xD;
He gave his life for me!&#xD;
Jesus, my heart is thine,&#xD;
O make it humbly shine&#xD;
With ever-living love to thee!&#xD;
"0 Jesus, our Great Friend,&#xD;
Our Saviour, without end&#xD;
Thy praises we will bring!&#xD;
Glory to God's high throne!&#xD;
Peace now on earth is known,&#xD;
And we for joy may ever sing!"&#xD;

SAY AND SEAL.                                  SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Therc"-Mr. Linden said,       the hush into which&#xD;
the children had subsided, and gently disengaging himself&#xD;
from them,-"now I have given you something to think&#xD;
of, and you must do it, and let me go." And he and Faith&#xD;
were presently on their way; Faith feeling that she had&#xD;
'something to think of' too.&#xD;
The sun was testing fast as they turned,' but now their&#xD;
way lay towards home, via sundry other places. The long&#xD;
sunbeams were passing lovely as they lay upon the snow,&#xD;
and the fantastic shadows of Jerry and the sleigh and all it&#xD;
held, were in odd harmony and contrast. The poverty-&#xD;
stricken house to~ which the two had walked that memora-&#xD;
ble night, had been already visited and passed, and several&#xD;
others with sick or poor inhabitants. Then Mr. Linden&#xD;
turned off down one of the scarce broken by-roads, arid&#xD;
stopped before a little lonely brown house with an old but-&#xD;
tonwood tree in front.&#xD;
"There is a blanket to go in here, Faith," he said as he&#xD;
took her out, "and also my hammer 1-for there is always&#xD;
something to do."&#xD;
"Always something to do at this house ?"&#xD;
"Yes," he answered laughingly,-" so you must hold in&#xD;
check your aversion to carpenters."&#xD;
"If you'll ~please have a charity for the butcher and&#xD;
baker, and tell me what I shall take in here? for my part."&#xD;
"0 we'll go in and find out,-these good people are&#xD;
never just suited unless they have the ordering of every.&#xD;
thing. They'll tell us what they want fast enough, but if&#xD;
we guessed at it beforehand, they would maybe find out&#xD;
that those were just the things they did not want. Only&#xD;
my hammer-I'm sure of that."&#xD;
The "good people" in question, were an old man and&#xD;
his wife, living in one little room and with very little furni-&#xD;
ture. Very deaf the old man was, and both of them din-&#xD;
sighted, so that the old bible on the shelf was only a thing&#xD;
to look at,-if indeed it had ever been anything more,&#xD;
which some people doubted. This was one of the first&#xD;
things Mr. Linden took hold of after the kind greetings&#xD;
were passed, and he gave it to Faith; telling her that old&#xD;
Mr. Roscor~ always expected his visitors to read to him,&#xD;
&#xD;
and that if she would do that, he would mend Mrs. lbs.&#xD;
corn's spinning-wheel--which he saw was ready for him.&#xD;
: Faith threw back her hood and her furs, and took a seat&#xD;
close by the old man; and the first thing he heard was her&#xD;
sweet voice asking him where she should read, or if he&#xD;
liked to hear any part in particular.&#xD;
"No," he s4d, "he liked to have it surprise him."&#xD;
Faith pondered how she should best surprise him, but&#xD;
she had not much time to spare and no chance to ask&#xD;
counsel. So she read as her heart prompted her,-first&#xD;
the fifth chapter of IL Corinthians-with its joyful Chris~&#xD;
tian profession and invitation to others; then she read the&#xD;
account of Jesus', healing the impotent man and bidding&#xD;
him "sin ~no more"; and then she turned over to the&#xD;
Psalms and gave Mr. iRoscom the beautiful 103d psalm of&#xD;
thanksgiving,-which after those other two passages&#xD;
seemed particularly beautiful. This was work that Faith&#xD;
loved, and she read so.&#xD;
How softly the hammer worked while she read, she&#xD;
mio'lt have noticed if her mind had not been full* but&#xD;
though she had no word from that quarter, Mr. Roscom's&#xD;
opinion was clear.&#xD;
"That's good,'7 he said,-" and strong;-and I'm obleeged&#xD;
to ~&#xD;
And then, the wheel being near done, there was a little&#xD;
skilful talk gone into; in the course of which Faith and&#xD;
Mr. Linden learned, that the old couple were "real tired&#xD;
of salt meat, some days"-and that rye bread "warnt&#xD;
thought wholesome by itself"-and that "if their tea.&#xD;
should give out they didn't know what they should do 1"-&#xD;
and,~that "times when the old man was a little poorly,&#xD;
nothing on airth would serve him but a roasted potato 1"&#xD;
All of which was said just for the pleasure of talking to&#xD;
sympathizing faces;-withop.t the least idea of what' was at&#xD;
the door. The blanket wa~ too old a want to be spoken ot;&#xD;
but Faith needed only to look at the bed. And then she&#xD;
looked at Mr. Linden, in delighted watch to see what his&#xD;
next move would be; in the intervals of her chat with Mr.&#xD;
1{oscom, which was very likely.&#xD;
Mr. Linden had finished his work, and stood balancing&#xD;

&#xD;
his hammer and listening to the catalogue of wants.with a&#xD;
smile both grave and bright.&#xD;
"Are these just the things you wish for?" he said.&#xD;
"Well -'your Father knoweth that ye have need of them,'&#xD;
-and he has sent them by. our hands to-day; so you see&#xD;
that you may trust him for the future."&#xD;
He laid his hand on Faith's shoulder as an invitation to&#xD;
her to follow, and went out to the sleigh. She was at the&#xD;
side of it as soon as he, and in it the next minute, stopping&#xD;
to give him only with the eye one warm speech of sym~&#xD;
pathy and joy.&#xD;
"You haven't put up a basket specially for th~se people,&#xD;
of course," she said,-" so we shall have to take the things&#xD;
from everywhere. There's a beautiful chicken in that bas-&#xD;
ket, Endecott -I know; that's the largest one we have&#xD;
Thft; and bread---there aren't but two loaves here !-shall&#xD;
we give them both? or do we want one somewhere else ?"&#xD;
"I think we may give them both. And Faith-don't&#xD;
you think a roasted apple might alternate usefully witI~ the&#xD;
potato?"&#xD;
Faith dived into the receptacle for apples and brought&#xD;
out a good quantity of the right kind. Potatoes were not&#xD;
in very large supply, but tea and sugar were-blessed&#xD;
things !-unfailing.&#xD;
~ "And here is a pumpkin pie 1" said Faith---" I am sure&#xD;
* they'll like that-and as many cookies and cruller 'as you&#xD;
like. And what else, Endecott ?-O here's a pair of those&#xD;
big socks mother knit-wouldn't they be good here ?"&#xD;
"Very good, dear child !-.-~and this bl ~nket must go-&#xD;
and some tracts,-that will furnish more reading. You&#xD;
run in with those, Faith-these other things are too heavy&#xD;
for you."&#xD;
"I've strength enough to carry a blanket," said Faith&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
"Well, run oft' with that too, then," said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
"only if your strength gives out by the way, please 'to fall&#xD;
on the blanket."&#xD;
Faith managed to reach the house safely and with a&#xD;
bright face deposited the blanket on a chair. "I got leave&#xD;
to bring this in to ~you, Mrs. IRoscom," she said. "I sup-&#xD;
pose you know what Mr. Linden means you to do with it."&#xD;
&#xD;
Perhaps they had' seen no two people in the course of the&#xD;
day more thoroughly pleased than these two. The sources&#xD;
of pleasure were not many in that house, and the expectation&#xD;
of pleasure not strong; and the need of comforts had not&#xD;
die.d out with the supply; and old and alone as they were,&#xD;
the looking forward to possible cold and hunger was a&#xD;
trial. It was easy to see how that blanket warmed the&#xD;
room and promised a mild winter, and how the socks be-&#xD;
came liniment,- and it seemed doubtful whether the old&#xD;
man would ever be sick enough for roast potatoes, with the&#xD;
potatoes really in. the house. So with other things,.-.they&#xD;
took a childish pleasure even in the cakes and pie, and an&#xD;
order for wood was a real relief. And what a dinner they&#xD;
were already eating in imagination!&#xD;
Mr. Linden had put Faith in the sleigh, with the last&#xD;
sunset rays playing about her; and he stood wrapping her&#xD;
up in all sorts of ways, and the old man and the old woman&#xD;
stood in the door to see. Then in a voice which he sup-&#xD;
posed to be a whisper, Mr. Roscom said,-&#xD;
"Be she his wife ?"&#xD;
"He didn't say-and I don' know what he said," screamed&#xD;
Mrs. Roscom.&#xD;
"Wal -she's handsome enough for it -and so's he;"&#xD;
said the old man contemplatively~ "I hope he'll get one&#xD;
as good!"&#xD;
Very merrily Mr. Linden laughed as they drove away.&#xD;
"I hope I shall !" he said. "Fa~ith, what do you think&#xD;
of that? And which of u~ has the compliment ?"&#xD;
But Faith was engaged in pulling her furs and buffaiG&#xD;
robes round her, and did not appear to consider compli-&#xD;
ments even a matter of moonshine; much less of sunshine..&#xD;
Her first words were to remark upon the exceeding beauty&#xD;
of the last touch the sunlight was giving to certain snowy&#xD;
heights and white cumuli floating above them; a touch so&#xD;
fair and calm as if heaven were setting its own seal on this&#xD;
bright day.&#xD;
"Is your head in the clouds ?" Mr. Linden said, bending&#xD;
down to look at her with his laughing eyes. "flow can&#xD;
you abstract your thoughts so suddenly from all sublunary&#xD;
affairs! Do you want any more wrapping up ?"&#xD;

A4little flashing glance of most naive appeal, and Faith's&#xD;
eyes went down absolutely.&#xD;
"You may as well laugh I" he said. "One cannot get&#xD;
through the world without occasionally hearing frightful&#xD;
suggestions."&#xD;
Faith did laugh, and gave him another good little look,&#xD;
about which the only remarkable thing was that it was&#xD;
afraid to stay.&#xD;
"What were your cloudy remarks just now?" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden.&#xD;
"I wanted you to look at the beautiful light on them.&#xD;
and those far-ow ridges of hill-.it is not gone yet."&#xD;
Yes, they are very beautiful. But I believe I am not&#xD;
in a meditative mood to-day,----or else the rival colours&#xD;
distract me. Faith, I mean to pQt you in the witness-box&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"In the witness-box ?"-she said with a mental jump to&#xD;
Neanticut, and a look to suit.&#xD;
"Yes-but we are not on the banks of Kildeer river,&#xD;
and need not be afraki," ~e said with a smile. "Faith&#xD;
in-what ever made you take such an aversion to Phil&#xD;
Davids ?"&#xD;
"I don't dislike him,".-she ~4d softly.&#xD;
"I did not mean to doubt y~ir forgiving disposition!&#xD;
But what did he do to displease you ?"&#xD;
Did Mr. Linden know? or did he not know! Faith&#xD;
looked up to see. He was jus~~en~gj~ing one of the&#xD;
lines from JIetj~y's tail, but met her look wTtlii great com-&#xD;
posure.&#xD;
"It's an old thing,"- said Faith. "It's not worth&#xD;
bringing up.&#xD;
- "But since I have brought it-..won't you indulge me&#xD;
The red on Faith's cheeks grew brilliant. "It isn't any~&#xD;
thing you would like,-if I told it to you.-Won't you let&#xD;
me let it alone ?"&#xD;
"I should like to hear you tell it."&#xD;
"He made one, or two rude speeches"-said Faith in&#xD;
very treat doubt and confusion ;-." that was all."&#xD;
"That I knew before."&#xD;
"Did you ~" said Faith looking at him. "How did you&#xD;
know it, Endecott ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
K     There was a curious gentle, almost tender, modulation&#xD;
of tone in this last sentence, which covered a good deal of&#xD;
 possible ground. Mr. Linden drew up one of her mufflers&#xD;
which had fallen off a little, giving her as he did so a silent&#xD;
though laughing answer, as comprehensive as her qi~es-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"You are just the dearest and most precious little child&#xD;
in the whole world I" he said. "But why are you afraid&#xD;
to tell me now?-and why did Phil's insinuation cause you&#xD;
such dismay ?"&#xD;
Faith's confusion would have been, as her rosy flush&#xD;
was, extreme,-if. something in Mr. Linden's manner had&#xD;
not met that and rebuked it, healing the wound almost&#xD;
before it was made. Between the two Faith struggled&#xD;
for a standing-ground of equaniniity,-but words, though&#xD;
she struggled for them tool in her reason or imagination&#xD;
she could not find.&#xD;
"I want an answer to one of these questions,"- Mr.&#xD;
Linden said, in a playful sort of tone. "Dr. Harrison&#xD;
used to ask me if you lived upon roses-but do you think&#xD;
Ican?"&#xD;
4     Faith made an effort. "What do you want me to&#xD;
say ?"&#xD;
"What was it in Phil's words that troubled you so&#xD;
much?"&#xD;
The crimson rush came back overwhelmingly. "Oh&#xD;
Endy-please don't ask me!"&#xD;
'IN ot quite fair," he said smiling. "I'm sure I am&#xD;
willing to tell you anything. Though indeed I do not&#xD;
suppose you need much telling. But Faith-is that the&#xD;
system of tactics by which you intend always to have&#xD;
your own way ? I shall have to be philosophical to any&#xD;
"That speech is so very zigzag," said Faith, "that I&#xD;
cannot follow it. How are you going to be philosophical,&#xD;
Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"Not by forgetting to exact your forfeit, Miss Dir-&#xD;
rick."&#xD;
"That isn't fair," said Faith laughing. "I didn't for-&#xD;
get I-I shouldn't think you had gone all day without eat~&#xD;
ing anything I-and yet you must be starving."&#xD;

"Does that mean that you are suffering ?-because if&#xD;
that be the case, I will .rcfresh you (cautiously) with sugar-&#xD;
plums! A very superfluous thing, to be sure, but the most&#xD;
suitable I can think of."&#xD;
Faith's laugh came clear now. "No indeed. Suffer-&#xD;
ing! I never eat so many dinners in one day in my life.&#xD;
But I am hungry though, I believe. How many more&#xD;
places are we going to? I don't care how many," she said&#xD;
earnestly. "I like to be hungry."&#xD;
"Well, keep up your spirits,-the next turn will bring&#xD;
us out of the woods, and a three-minute stay at one or&#xD;
two doors xviii end our. work for this time. Meanwhile,&#xD;
do you want to hear a little bit of good poetry-on an&#xD;

She gave him a wistful look as he finished the lines;&#xD;
and then sat among her furs, as quiet again as a mouse.&#xD;
"Do you like them, Mignonette ?"&#xD;
"Yes-.very much."&#xD;
"Would you like to tell me then why the hearing of them&#xD;
makes you s&amp;amp;ber ?"&#xD;
"Yes-if you wish "; she said gently. "I know-a little&#xD;
..-J believe,-what you think of me; but what I seem to&#xD;
your eyes on the outside-and much more !-I want to be&#xD;
really, really-in the sight of the eye that tries the heart.-&#xD;
and I am ff6t now, Endy."&#xD;
"My dear child-" he said,-and s silent a minute,&#xD;
speeding smoothly .along~ through the starlight; then went&#xD;
on.&#xD;
"Yes, dear Faith,-that is what I wish for you-and&#xD;
for myself. That is where we will most earnestly try to&#xD;
&#xD;
help each other." And presently, as eye and thoughts&#xD;
were caught and held by the wonderful constellation above&#xD;
in the clear sky~ yet not drawn away from what they had&#xD;
been talking of, Mr. Linden said,-&#xD;
'Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion,~&#xD;
that hringeth the shadow of death upon the day, and turn-&#xD;
eth the night into morning!"' And so, in the thought of&#xD;
that, they went home; Orion looking down upon them,&#xD;
and they leaving bits of brightness by the way at the two&#xD;
or three houses which yet remained. The box sleigh got&#xD;
home at last emptied of all its load but the two travellers.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick and supper were ready for them, and had&#xD;
been a good whiZ and by this time Mr. Linden and Faith&#xD;
were ready for supper. And much as Mrs. Derrick had to&#xD;
hear, she had something to tell. How Judge Harrison&#xD;
had come to make a visit and say good-bye, and how he&#xD;
had put in her hands another twenty-five dollars to be&#xD;
jidded to those his son had already bestowed on Reuben.&#xD;
Squire Stoutenburgh too had been thei~'e; but his errand&#xD;
was ~to declare that Jerry could never be received again&#xD;
into his service , but must henceforth remain in Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick's stable and possession. Altogether, the day even at&#xD;
home had been an exciting one.&#xD;
A little time after supper Faith went into the sitting-&#xD;
room. Mr. Linden was there alone. Faith came up to&#xD;
the back of his chair, laid a hand on his shoulder, and&#xD;
bent her head into speaking neighbourhood. It may be&#xD;
remained, that though Faith no longer said "Mr. Linden,"&#xD;
yet that one other word of his name was never spoken just&#xD;
like her other words. There was always a little lowering&#xD;
or alteration of tone, a slight pause before-or after it,&#xD;
which set and marked it as bordered round with all the&#xD;
regards which by any phrase could be made known.&#xD;
"Endecott"-she said very softly,-" do you know what&#xD;
you have been doing to-day ?"&#xD;
"Comprehensively speaking-I have been enjoying my-&#xD;
self," he said with a bright smile at her.&#xD;
"You have been giving me a lesson all the while, that&#xD;
I felt through and through."&#xD;
"Through and through ?" ~he repeated. "Come round&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
M R S. DERRICK went to Pequot the next day, and&#xD;
found Miss Danforth as Faith had left her; or rather,&#xD;
somewhat more failing in everything but mind-strength.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick was greatly xvelcomed by both ladies; but&#xD;
she had not been there three hours when Miss Dilly spoke&#xD;
out what was on her heart.&#xD;
"Isn't Faith coming back to me again ?"&#xD;
For Faith's sake her mother hesitated, and yet it was&#xD;
for Faith's sake that she answered,-" Yes, if you want&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"It won't be for long I shall want her,"-said Miss&#xD;
Dilly with a quietness very unlike her old self:-" but I&#xD;
would like to have her dear face and music about me onc~&#xD;
more-if~he can let me."&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick came back with Mr. Stoutenburgh to&#xD;
Pattaquasset that same evening; and Faith put up her&#xD;
books and made immediate preparations. for going to&#xD;
Pequot in her ~tead.&#xD;
"I must let you go, child," said her mother,-.-" I couldn't&#xD;
refuse."&#xD;
"And I am so glad to-morrow is Wednesday, for I can&#xD;
take you over," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
Wednesday afternoon was very fair, and after dinner&#xD;
Faith and all her needful baggage were bestowed in the&#xD;
little sleigh, and the journey began. Not very much of &amp;amp;&#xD;
journey indeed, unless compared with the length of day-&#xD;
light; but as fair and bright and pleasant as a journey&#xD;
could be. Full of talk of all sorts,-gliding on through&#xD;
th'e fading day and the falling night, until&#xD;
-." the floor of heaven&#xD;
Was thick inlaid with patines of bright g~dd."&#xD;
Very bright the stars were, very dark the sky, when&#xD;
Jerry's bells began to mingle with a crowd of others in the&#xD;

streets of Pequot. Faith had insisted that Mr. Linden&#xD;
should come in and have a cup of tea or coffee before he&#xD;
went back again; and this being a not unreasonable re-&#xD;
quest, besides a pleasant one, she had her way.&#xD;
Miss Danf'orth was in her room and could not see Mr.&#xD;
Linden. Faith with a kiss and a word established the&#xD;
little Frenchwoman to talk to him, obtaining leave to do&#xD;
what she pleased; though Madame Danfortli managed to&#xD;
have her share in the hospitality; got out cups and saucers&#xD;
for Faith and Mr. Linden both on a little table by the fire,&#xD;
.-.her rolls and her butter; talking all the while to him;&#xD;
and took a minute to run down into the kitchen and see&#xD;
that Faith and the coffee-pot were getting on properly.&#xD;
And it may be said in passing that the result did credit to&#xD;
both. The coffee served to Mr. Linden was faultless.&#xD;
Madame iDanforth however had hardly presented hi n~ his&#xD;
cup, when she was called off and her guests were left alone.&#xD;
"Faith," said Mr. Linden, "yoa must not forget that&#xD;
you have something to do for me as well as for other people&#xD;
while you are here."&#xD;
"I don't forget it. Bitt what do you mean, Ende..&#xD;
eott ?"&#xD;
"To put it in the most effective way-I mean that you&#xD;
must take care of me !" he said smiling.&#xD;
"I will. As good care as you would take of your-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"That is a little ambiguous! But will you send ~me&#xD;
word very often of your success ?"&#xD;
Faith looked up and looked at him, a little startled.&#xD;
"Do you mean-"&#xD;
"I mean that there is a postoflice in Pattaquasset-and&#xD;
another in Pequot."&#xD;
She coloured, and somewhat hastily busied herself with&#xD;
refilling Mr. Linden's cups Then she folded her hands and&#xD;
sat looking into the fire with a face on which there was a&#xD;
touching expression of humbleness.&#xD;
"My little Mignonette," he said, "what are you think-&#xD;
ing of?"&#xD;
"I am thinking of that,"-she said with a smile which&#xD;
did not change the expression. "Of what you want me to&#xD;
do-and about it."&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.              81&#xD;
&#xD;
"What about it? Are you inviting a letter to me on&#xD;
the spot?"&#xD;
"What then ?"&#xD;
Faith would have liked to have her face out of sight, but&#xD;
she couldn't, conveniently.&#xD;
"I am thinking, how I shall do it-and how you will&#xD;
not like it."&#xD;
"You don't know"-said Mr. Linden. "Let me tell you&#xD;
how I shall like it. I shall read it, and love it, and answer&#xD;
it-will that satisfy you? or do you want me to hang it&#xD;
round my neck by a blue ribband?.-because if you do, i:&#xD;
will."&#xD;
The laughing flash of Faith's eye contained nevertheless&#xD;
a protest.&#xD;
"No, you will not like it, because it will not be fit for&#xD;
you to like; but you will have patience with it,"-.-she said&#xD;
with a smile which did in its loveliness bi4 good-bye to&#xD;
shadows.&#xD;
Mr. Linden Thft the table, and standing before her as she&#xD;
had risen too, took her face softly in both hands and raised&#xD;
it up for his inspection.&#xD;
"Do you know what a naughty child you are ?"&#xD;
.A most quaint little "yes."&#xD;
"Then why don't you behave better ?" he said, enforcing&#xD;
his question but not releasing her.&#xD;
"I suppose you will teach me, in time"-she said, blush-&#xD;
ing and sparkling under his hands. He seemed to like to&#xD;
study her face-or was thinking that he should not see it&#xD;
again for some time,~-the expression on his own belonged&#xD;
to more than one thing.&#xD;
"You must not make me wait for that letter, Faith," he&#xD;
said-" and I must not let you keep me any longer here!&#xD;
But if you want anything, of any sort, you must send to&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"Yes !-to you or to mother."&#xD;
"To me-if it is anything I can. do," he said *~s he&#xD;
bade her good-bye. "And take care of yourself, dear child,&#xD;
for me." And releasing her at last, none too willingly,&#xD;
Mr. Linden went out alone into the starlight, lie did not&#xD;
see-nor guess-~--how Faith stood before the fire. where he&#xD;

&#xD;
had left her, looking down into it,-.rnotionle ss and grave&#xD;
until Madame Danforth came back. Then all that part&#xD;
of her life was shut up within her; and Faith was again to&#xD;
other eyes what she had been before at Pequot. Yet not&#xD;
so entirely the same, nor was all that part of he life so&#xD;
entirely shut up to herself, that both her ann t~an'd~ Madame&#xD;
Danforth did not have a thought and exchange a word on&#xD;
the subject.&#xD;
"The sun has found the blossom !" said the little French-&#xD;
woman knowingly one day; "they do not open so without&#xD;
~     that!"&#xD;
"Nonsense !" said Miss Danforth. "I will ask her."&#xD;
But she never did.&#xD;
And for a little while again Faith filled her old office.&#xD;
Miss Dilly had no troubles or darkness to clear away now;&#xD;
the Bible was plain sailing to her; but she could never&#xD;
spread her sails too soon or too full for that navigation.&#xD;
Early and late, as before, Faith read to her, with a joy and&#xD;
gladness all brightened from the contrast of that Sunday&#xD;
night's reading, and coming with a fuller spring since that&#xD;
one little word of her mother the same night. Indeed the&#xD;
last few days had seemed to make the Bible even greatly more&#xD;
precious tp Faith than ever before. She clung more fast, she&#xD;
searched more eagerly, among its treasures of riches, to its&#xD;
pillars of strength; valneing them all, as it seemed to her,&#xD;
with a new value, with a fresh knowledge of what might&#xD;
be found and won there for others and herself. So with&#xD;
the very eagerness of love Faith read the Bible to Miss&#xD;
Dilly; and so as she had done before, many a time, early&#xD;
and late, in childlike simpleness prayed at her bedside and&#xD;
by her chair. And as before when she was at Pequot she&#xD;
won Madame Danforth's heart, she intrenched herself there&#xD;
now. She was all over the house, carrying a sunbeam&#xD;
with her; but Faith never thought it was her own. She&#xD;
was a most efficient maid of all work, for nursing and&#xD;
too much care had worn poor Madame Danforth not a&#xD;
little. Faith was upper servant and cook by turns; and&#xD;
sometimes went to market; made every meal pleasant with&#xD;
her gentle happy ways; and comforted the two old ladies&#xD;
to the very top of comfort.&#xD;
Whether she wanted to be at home or not, Faith did not&#xD;
&#xD;
stop to ask herself. But those letters-those letters-they&#xD;
were written, and they were carried to the postoffice&#xD;
and others were found at the postoffice in reply to them.&#xD;
And what had been such trial in the proposition, became,&#xD;
even in the first instance, the joy of Faith's life. She&#xD;
wr6te hers how she could; generally at night, when she&#xD;
could be quite uninterrupted and alone. It was often very&#xD;
late at ni gift, but it was always a time of rare pleasure and&#xD;
liberty of } heart; for if the body were tired; the spirit wag&#xD;
free. And Faith's was particularly free, for the manacles&#xD;
and fetters of pride which weigh so bitter heavy on many&#xD;
a mind and life, her gentle and true spirit had let fall.&#xD;
She knew-nobody better-that her letters were not like&#xD;
those.letters o~ Mr. Linden's sister, Pet :--those exquisite&#xD;
letters, where every grace and every talent of a finely&#xD;
gifted and fully cultivated mind seemed playing together&#xD;
with all the rich stores of the past and /realities of the&#xD;
present. She knew, that in very style and formalities of&#xD;
execution, her own letters were imperfect and unformed.&#xD;
But she was equally sure that in time what was wrong in~&#xD;
this kind would be made right~; and she was not afraid to&#xD;
be found wrong, at all, for her own sake. It was because&#xD;
of somebody else, that she had flinched from this writing&#xD;
proposal; because she felt that what was wrong in her&#xD;
touched him now. But there again, Faith wrdte, trusting&#xD;
with an absolute trust in the heart and hand to which she&#xD;
sent her letters; willing to be found wrong if need be;&#xD;
sure to be set right truly and gently. And so, Faith wrote&#xD;
her own heart and life out, from day to day, giving Mr.&#xD;
Linden precisely what he wanted, and with a child's fear~&#xD;
lessness. It was a great thing to go to the postoffice those-&#xD;
days! Faith left it to nobody else to do for her. And&#xD;
how strange-how weird,. almost, the signature of those&#xD;
letters and her own name on the outside looked to her, in&#xD;
the same free, graceful handwriting which she had read on&#xD;
that little card so long ago! And the letters themselves?&#xD;
.-....enough to say, that they made Faith think of the way&#xD;
she had been sheltered from the wind, and carried upstairs&#xD;
when her strength failed, and read to and talked to and&#xD;
instructed,.-that they made her long to be home andyet cona&#xD;
tent to be there; giving her all sorts of details, of things in&#xD;

Pattaquasset and things elsewhere-just as the writer would&#xD;
have talked them to her; with sometimes a word of counsel,&#xD;
or of caution, or of suggestion,.-..or some old German hymn&#xD;
which she might find of use in her ministrations, written&#xD;
Out in full. It may be mentioned in passing, that the fair&#xD;
little face he had been looking at, or her evident fear of&#xD;
writing to him, made Mr. Linden write to her that very&#xD;
night; a little sugarplum of a letter, which Faith had for&#xD;
her dinner next day.&#xD;
And Faith read these letters at all sorts of times, and&#xD;
thought of them at other times; and made them next to&#xD;
her Bible-as she should&#xD;

CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
pv 0 weeks passed quietly, without much apparent&#xD;
change in Miss Danforth; and Faith was beginning&#xD;
to think of appointing a time to go home. But the neces-&#xD;
sity for that was suddenly superseded. The Friday follow-&#xD;
ing, Miss Dilly took a change for the worse, and Saturday&#xD;
she died. Faith sent off tidings immediately to Pattaquas~.&#xD;
set; but her letter could not reach there till Monday; and&#xD;
Monday came a very great fall of snow w ich made trav-&#xD;
elling impossible. Faith waited patiently, comforting Ma-&#xD;
dame Danforth as she might, and endeavouring to win her to&#xD;
some notion of that joy in the things of the Bible in which&#xD;
Miss Dilly had lived and died. For no change had come&#xD;
over Miss Dilly's sky; and she had set sail from the shores&#xD;
of earth in the very sunlight.&#xD;
It fell out, that Faith's letter of Saturday afternoon had&#xD;
been five minutes too late for the mail; and after lying in&#xD;
the office at Pequot over Sunday, had been again subjected&#xD;
to the delays of Monday's storm, which in its wild fury put&#xD;
a stop to everything else; and thus, when Mr. Linden went&#xD;
to the office Tuesday morning before school time, the mail&#xD;
had not yet got in. Not long after, however, Mr. Skip&#xD;
brought home the letters; and Mrs. Derrick reading hers,&#xD;
at once took Mr. Skip and Jerry and set off for Pequot;&#xD;
minding neither snowdrifts nor driving win 41, when the road&#xD;
to Faith lay through them, and arriving there quite safe&#xD;
about the hour of midday.&#xD;
The delayed funeral took place the same afternoon. And&#xD;
the next morning, in a brilliant cold day, snow all over the'&#xD;
ground, and the sky all blue, the mother and daughter&#xD;
set forth homewards. Madame Danfortli was going to&#xD;
ta~ e another re4fition in, and live on still in the little&#xD;
house where she and her sister-in-law had made a happy&#xD;
home for. so many years. Miss Danforth had left a few&#xD;
hundreds, three or four, to Faith. It was all she had&#xD;
owned in the world; her principal living having been an&#xD;

annuity settled upon her by her brother, which reverted to&#xD;
Madame IDanforth.&#xD;
It was about midafternoon when they reached home,&#xD;
and of course the house held no one but Cindy; except in~&#xD;
deed that sort of invisible presence which books and other&#xD;
inanimate things make known; and Cindy had to tell&#xD;
of two or three visitors, but otherwise nothing. Very&#xD;
fair it all looked to Faith,-very sweet to her ear was the&#xD;
sound of the village clock, although as yet it was only&#xD;
striking three. She did not say much about the matter.&#xD;
A gleeful announcement that she was glad to ~b~' at home,&#xD;
she made to Mrs. Derrick; int after that she expressed&#xD;
herself in action. One of her first moves was to the&#xD;
kitchen, deterni~ed that there should be a double con-&#xD;
sciousness of her being at home when supper-time came.&#xD;
Then books were got out, and fires put in wonderful order.&#xD;
Mr. Linden might guess, from the state in which he found&#xD;
his room, that it had come under its old rule. No such&#xD;
fire had greeted him there for weeks; no such brushed-up&#xD;
clean hearth; no such delicate arrangement of table and&#xD;
chairs and curtains and couch. But the fire burned quietly&#xD;
and told no tales, otherwise than by its very orderly snap-&#xD;
ping and sparkling.&#xD;
And indeed it so happened, that Mr. Linden went first&#xD;
into the sitting-room,.---partly to see if any one was there,&#xD;
partly because the day was cold, and under Cindy's man-&#xD;
agement there was small reason to suppose that his room&#xD;
was warm. And once there, the easy-chair reminded him&#xD;
so strongly that he was tired, that he even sat down in it&#xD;
before going upstairs,.-which combination a long walk&#xD;
through the snowdrifts since school, m~i4~ very accept able.&#xD;
Five ~minutes after, Faith having got rid~ of her kitchen&#xD;
apron, opened softly the door of the sitting-room. She&#xD;
stopped an instant, and then came forward, her gladness&#xD;
not at all veiled by a very rosy veil of shy modesty. There&#xD;
was no stay in his step to meet her,-he had sprung up&#xD;
with the first sound of her foot on the threshold; and how&#xD;
much she had been missed and longed for Faith might&#xD;
guess, from the glad silence in which she was held fast and&#xD;
for a minutenot allowed to speak h~rself. So very glad !-&#xD;
she could see it and feel it exceedingly as he brought her&#xD;
&#xD;
F ~ forward to the fire, and lifted up her face, and looked at it&#xD;
with eyes that were not easily satisfied.&#xD;
"My little Sunbeam," he said, "how lovely you are&#xD;
She had been laughing and flushing' with a joy almost as&#xD;
frankly shown as his own; but that brought a change over&#xD;
hei face. The eyes fell7 and the line of the lips was unbent&#xD;
after a different fashion.&#xD;
"I don't know what it is like to see you again," Mr.&#xD;
Linden said as his own touched them once more,-&#xD;
"like any amount of balm and rest and refreshment!&#xD;
how long have you been here, dear child? and how do&#xD;
you do ?.-aiid have you any~idea how glad I am to have.&#xD;
you home ?"&#xD;
She answered partly in dumb show, ciA~ping one hand&#xD;
upon his shoulder and laying down her head upon it. Her&#xD;
words were very quiet and low-spoken.&#xD;
"We came home a while ago-and I am very well."&#xD;
Mr. Linden rested his face lightly upon her shining hair,&#xD;
and was silent.-.till Faith wondered; little guessing what&#xD;
thoughts the absence and the meeting and above all her&#xD;
mute expression, had stirred; nor what bitterness was&#xD;
wrapped in those sweet minutes. But he put it aside,&#xD;
and then took the. sweetness pure and unmixed; giv-&#xD;
ing her about as much sunshine as he said she gave&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"How do you like writing to me, Faith ?" he said. "Am&#xD;
I, on the whole, any more terrific at a distance than near&#xD;
by?"&#xD;
"I didn't know you could be so good at a distance,"-.&#xD;
she said expressively.&#xD;
"Did you find out what reception your letters met ?"&#xD;
"I didn't want to find out." S&#xD;
"Do you call that an answer ?" he said smiling. "Why&#xD;
didn't you want to find out ?-and did you ?"&#xD;
"Why !"-said Faith,-" I didn't want to find out be-&#xD;
cause it wasn't necessary. I did find out that I liked to&#xD;
write. But you wouldn't have liked it if you had known&#xD;
what time of night it was, oPen."&#xD;
"What do you think of taking up a new study ?" said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "It~ strikes me that it would do you good&#xD;
to stand in the witness-box half an hour every day,-jusV~&#xD;

for practice. Faith - did you find out what reception&#xD;
your letters met ?"&#xD;
"I knew before-." she said, meeting his eyes.&#xD;
"Did you !-.then what made you assure me I should not&#xD;
like them ?"&#xD;
"I don't think you did, Endecott-the parts of them&#xD;
that you oughtn't to have liked."&#xD;
"Truly I think not !" he said laughing. "You are on&#xD;
safe ground there, little Mignonette. But speaking of lot-&#xD;
ters-..do you want more tidings from Italy ?"&#xD;
"0 yes! if you please. Are they good? And has all&#xD;
been good here with you anddhe school since I have been&#xD;
away ?"&#xD;
"Yes, they a~e good,-.-my sister.-.and yours-.is enjoy-&#xD;
ing herself reasonably. And the boys have been good,-.&#xD;
and I-have wanted my Mignonette."&#xD;
One word in that speech brought a soft play of&#xD;
colour to Faith's face, but her words did not touch&#xD;
that point.&#xD;
The days wont on very quietly after that, and the weeks&#xD;
followed,-quietly, regularly, full of business and pleasure.&#xD;
Quick steps were made in many things during those weeks,&#xD;
little interrupted by the rest of Pattaquasset, some of the&#xD;
most stirring people of that town being away. An occa-&#xD;
~sional tea-drinking did steal an. evening now and then, but&#xD;
also furnished the before and after walk or ride, and so on&#xD;
the whole did little mischief; and as Faith was now some-&#xD;
times taken on Mr. Linden's visits to another range of soci-&#xD;
ety, she saw more of him than ever; and daily learned more&#xD;
and more-not only of him, but of his care for her. His&#xD;
voice-never indeed harsh to any one-took its gentlest&#xD;
tones to her; his eye its softest and deepest lustre: no&#xD;
matter how tired he came home-the first sight of her&#xD;
seemed to banish all thought of fatigue. Faith could&#xD;
feel that she was the very delight of his life. Indeed, by&#xD;
degrees, she began to understand that she had 1ong been&#xD;
so-only there had once been a qualification,-now, the&#xD;
sunshine of his happiness had nothing to check its ex~&#xD;
pression, or its endeavour to make her life as bright.&#xD;
That he took "continual comfort" in~ her, Faith could&#xD;
see.&#xD;
&#xD;
.And-.child !-he did not see what this consciousness&#xD;
spurred her to do; hovv~ the strength of her heart spent&#xD;
itself-yet; was never spent-in efforts to grow and become&#xD;
more worthy of him and more fit for him to take comfort&#xD;
in. The days were short, and Faith's household duties not&#xD;
few, especially in the severe weather, when she could not&#xD;
let her mother be tried with efforts which in summer-time&#xD;
might be easy and pleasant enough. A good piece of&#xD;
every day was of necessity spent by Faith about house and&#xD;
in the kitchen, and faithfully ~given to its work. But her&#xD;
heart spurred her on to g~t knowledge. The times when&#xD;
Mr. Linden was out of school could rarely be study times,&#xD;
except of study with him; and to be prepared for him&#xD;
Faith was eager. She took times that were hers all alone.&#xD;
Nobody heard her noiseless footfall in the early morning&#xD;
down the stair. Long before it was light,-hours before.&#xD;
the sun thought of showing~ his face to the white Mong and&#xD;
the snowy houseroofs of Pattaquasset, Faith lighted her&#xD;
fire in the sitting-room, and her lamp on the table; and&#xD;
after what in the first place was often a good while with&#xD;
her Bible, she bent herself to the deep earnest absorbed&#xD;
pressing into the studies she was pursuing with Mr. Linden&#xD;
.-.-or such of them as the morning had time for. Faith&#xD;
could not lengthen the day at the other end; to prevent&#xD;
the sun was her only chance; and day after day and week&#xD;
after week, through the short days of February, she had&#xD;
done solid work and a deal of it before anybody in the&#xD;
house saw her face in the kitchen or at breakfast. They&#xD;
saw it then as bright as ever. Mr. Linden only knew that&#xD;
his scholar made very swift and smooth progress. ile&#xD;
would have known more, for Faith would have shown the&#xD;
effects of her early hours of work in her looks and life the&#xD;
rest of the day, but happiness is strong; and a mind abso-&#xD;
lutely at peace with God and the world has a great rest!&#xD;
Friction is said to be one of the notable hindering powers&#xD;
in the world of matter-it is equally true, perhaps, of the&#xD;
world.. of spirit. Without it, in either sphere, how softly&#xD;
and with how little wear and tear, everything moves I&#xD;
And Faith's life knew none.&#xD;

CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
I T was near the end of February,-.--.rather late in the&#xD;
afternoon of a by no means balmy day, iu the course&#xD;
of which Dr. Harrison had arrived to look after his repairs.&#xD;
But the workmen had stopped work and gone home to&#xD;
supper, and the doctor and his late dinner sat together.&#xD;
Luxuriously eno'~ugh, on the doctor's part, for the dinner&#xD;
was good and well cooked, the bottles of wine irreproacir.&#xD;
able (as' wine) in their silver stands, the little~ group of&#xD;
different coloured glasses shining in the firelight. The&#xD;
doctor's fingerbowl and napkin stood 'at hand, Cat this stage&#xD;
of the proceeding) his half pared apple was cLearly worth&#xD;
the trouble, and he himself-between the fire and his easy-&#xD;
chair-might be said to be "in the lap of comfort." Coin-&#xD;
fort rarely did much for him but take him on her lap,&#xD;
hQwever-he seldom stayed there; and on the present&#xD;
occasion the doctor's eyes were very wide open and his&#xD;
thoughts at work. Jt might be presumed that neither&#xD;
process was cut short, when the old black man opened the&#xD;
door and announced Mr. Linden.&#xD;
But if Mr. Linden could have seon the doctor's face just&#xD;
before, he might have supposed that his entrance had pro-&#xD;
duced rather a sedative effect. For the brow smoothed&#xD;
itself down, the eye took its light play and the mouth its&#xD;
light smile, and the doctor's advance to meet his' friend&#xD;
was marked with all its graceful and easy unconcern. ITo&#xD;
did not even seem energetic enough to be very glad; for&#xD;
grace and carelessness still blended in his welcome and&#xD;
in his hospitable attentions, nothing of which however was&#xD;
failing. He had presently made Mr. Linden as comfortable&#xD;
as himself, so far as possible outward appliances could ~e&#xD;
effectual; established him at a good side of the table;&#xD;
furnished him with fruit ~nd pressed him with wine; and&#xD;
then sitting at ease at his own corner, sipped his claret&#xD;
daintily, eyeing Mr. Linden good humouredly between sips;&#xD;
(90)&#xD;
&#xD;
but apparently too happily on good terms with Comfort to&#xD;
l)e in any wise eager or anxious as to whaf Mr. Linden's&#xD;
business might be, or whether he had any.&#xD;
"Has the news of my arrival flown over Pattaquasset&#xD;
already ?" said he. "I thought I had seen nothing but&#xD;
frieze jackets, and friezes of broken plaster-and I have&#xD;
certainly felt so much of another kind of freeze that I&#xD;
~houId hardly think even news could have stirred."&#xD;
Mr. Linden's reception of the doctor's hospitality had&#xD;
been merely nominal-except so far as face and voice had&#xD;
the receiving, and he answered quietly-&#xD;
"I don't know. I happened to want you, doctor, and so&#xD;
I found out that you werq here."&#xD;
"Want me? I am very glad to be wanted by you-so&#xD;
that it be not for you. What is it, my dear Linden ?"&#xD;
"No-you will not be glad," said Mr. Linden,-" though&#xD;
it is both for me and not for me. I want you to go with&#xD;
me to see one of my little scholars who is sick."&#xD;
"Who is he?"&#xD;
"One whom you have seen but will not remember,-&#xD;
Johnny Fax."&#xD;
Fax-" said the doctor.-"I remember the name, but&#xD;
no particular owner of it. What's the matter with him ?"&#xD;
"I want you to come and see."&#xD;
"Now ?".-&#xD;
"As near that as may be."&#xD;
"Now it shall be, then; though with such a February&#xD;
night on one side, it takes all your power on the other to&#xD;
draw me out of this chair. You don't look much like&#xD;
Comedy, and I am very little like the great buskin-wearer&#xD;
-but I would as lieve Tragedy had me by the other shoulder&#xD;
as February, when his fingers have been so very long away&#xD;
from the fire. Did you ever read Thomson'~ 'Castle of&#xD;
Indolence,' Linden ?"&#xD;
"Not to much purpose-the nam~is all I remember."&#xD;
"Stupid book,"-.said the doctor ;.-" but a delightful&#xD;
place 1"&#xD;
The luxury of broadcloth and furs in which the doctor&#xD;
was presently involved might have rendered him reasonably&#xD;
independent, one would think, of February or any other of&#xD;
Jack Frost's band. Jerry was at the door, and involving&#xD;

&#xD;
themselves still further in buffalo robes the two gentle.&#xD;
men drove to the somewhat distant farm settlement which&#xD;
called Jonathan Fax master. Mr. Fax was a well-to-do&#xD;
member of the Pattaquasset community, as far as means&#xD;
went; there was very little knowledge in his house how&#xD;
to make use of means. Nor many people to make use&#xD;
of the knowledge. The one feminine member of the&#xD;
family had lately married and gone off to take care of&#xD;
her own concerns, and Jonathan and his one other child&#xD;
lived on as best they might; the child being depeudant&#xD;
upon the maid of all work for his clothes and breakfast, for&#xD;
his' $unday lessons upon Faith, for the weekday teaching&#xD;
and comfort of his little life upon Mr. Linden. Living&#xD;
along in this somewhat divided way, the child had sQideidy&#xD;
taken sick-no ~ne just knew how; nor just what to do&#xD;
with him-except to send Mr. Linden word by one of the&#xD;
other boys, ~vhich had been done that afternoon. And&#xD;
thus it was, that Dr. Harrison had been looked for, found,&#xD;
and drawn out into the February night with only the slight&#xD;
protection of furs and broadcloth.&#xD;
Thus it was that after a short and rather silent dijvc,&#xD;
the two gentlemen went together into the last-century sort&#xD;
of a house, received the angular welcome of Jonathan Fax,&#xD;
and stood side by side by the bed where the sick child lay.&#xD;
Side by side-with what different faces! A difference&#xD;
which Johnny was quick to recognize. lie lay on the bed,&#xD;
wrapped in a little old plaid cloak, and with cheeks which&#xD;
rivalled its one remaining bright colour; and half unclosing&#xD;
his heavy eyes to see the doctor, he stretched out his arms&#xD;
to Mr. Linden, clasping them round his neck as his friend&#xD;
~at down on the bedside and gemitly lifted him up, and&#xD;
receiving the kiss on his flushed cheek with a little parting&#xD;
of the lips which said how glad he was. But then he lay&#xD;
quite still in Mr. Linden's arms.&#xD;
Whatever atti'actions the Castle of Indolence might&#xD;
have for Dr. ilarrison upon occasion, lie never seemed&#xD;
so much as to look that way when he was at this work.&#xD;
Now, it made iio difference that he was no friend of&#xD;
Johnny's; he gave his attention thoroughly and with all&#xD;
his skill to the condition and wants of hjs little patient.&#xD;
"Is there nobody to take care of him ?" he asked in&#xD;
&#xD;
French, for Jonathan Fax with his square and by no&#xD;
means delicate and tender physiognomy stood at the other&#xD;
side of the bed heavily looking on.&#xD;
"I shall, to-night," said Mr. Linden. "You may give&#xD;
me your directions."&#xD;
The doctor proceeded to do this; but added, "He wants&#xD;
care and good nursing; and he'll suffer if he don't have it.&#xD;
H~ is a sick child."&#xD;
"He shall have it," was all the answer; and when the&#xD;
doctor had finished his ~vork for the time, Mr. Linden laid&#xD;
the child on the bed again, giving him a whispered promise&#xD;
to come back and stay with him all night; upon the&#xD;
strength of which promise Johnny fell into a deep sleep.&#xD;
"Has the creature nobody to take care of him ?" said&#xD;
the doctor as they went out.&#xD;
"Nobody at home."&#xD;
"I shall be here a day or two, Linden-I'll see him early&#xD;
in the morning again."&#xD;
Mr. Linden's next move through the biting air was to&#xD;
drive home. At the door of the sitting-room Faith met&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Endecott-hqw is he ?"&#xD;
"Less well thtin I expected to find him, dear Faith. I&#xD;
found Dr. Harrison and took him there with me."&#xD;
"And what did Dr. Harrison say of him ?"&#xD;
"That he wanted good care and nursing."&#xD;
"And who is there to give it to him, Endy ?" she said&#xD;
:., with a very saddened and earnest face.&#xD;
"Why I shall give it to him to-night, my child,.~nd we'll&#xD;
see about to-morrow. The doctor promised to go there&#xD;
$ again in the morning."&#xD;
She stood a moment silent, and then said, "I'li go with&#xD;
"Not to-night, dear-it is not needful. He will not want&#xD;
more than one watcher."&#xD;
"But he might want something else-something to be&#xD;
done that a woman about the house might be wanted for-.&#xD;
let~nie go too !-"&#xD;
"No indeed! you must go to sleep. And he will hardly&#xD;
want anything but what I can give him to-night. I know&#xD;
well what your little hands are in a sick room," he said&#xD;

taking them in his own,-" I know well !-but they are not&#xD;
made of iron-nor are you.".&#xD;
Faith looked ill satisfied.&#xD;
"Well, you'll not hinder my taking your place by him&#xD;
to-morrow, Endy?"&#xD;
"If I can," Mr. Linden said, "1 shall come home to&#xD;
breakfast, and then II may know what you had better do;&#xD;
but if I should be detained there, and so not get ii crc till&#xD;
midday, wait for me -J should not like to have you go&#xD;
without seeing me again; and I can leave Reuben there&#xD;
for the morning if need be."&#xD;
"Oh Emidecott !.~-" she said with a heart full; but she&#xD;
said no more and ran away. She came back soon to call&#xD;
Mr. Linden to tea, which had waited; and after tea when&#xD;
he was about' going she put a basket in his hand.&#xD;
"I hope Mr. Fax has wood in his house, so t~$ at you can&#xD;
keep a fire,-but' you are not likely to find a~y~hing else&#xD;
there. You'll want everything that is in this, Endy-please&#xD;
remember."&#xD;
"I will not forget," he said, as he gave her his thanks.&#xD;
"But what did that exclamation mean, before tea ?"&#xD;
"What exclamation ?---Oh-" said Faith, smiling some-&#xD;
what but 'looking down, "I suppose it meant that I was&#xD;
disappointed."&#xD;
"My dear littl~ child-you must try not to feel disap-&#xD;
pointed, because I am 'quite sure you ought not to go; and&#xD;
that must content both you and me. So good night."&#xD;
Faith tried to be contented, but her little scholar lay oPi&#xD;
her heart. And it lay 'on her heart too, that Mr. Linden&#xD;
wquld be watching all night and teaching all day. He did&#xD;
not know how much he had disappointed, for she had laid&#xD;
~ fine plan to go by starlight in the morning to take his&#xD;
~1ace and send him home for a little rest before breakfast&#xD;
and school. Faith studied only one book that night, and&#xD;
that was her Bible.&#xD;
It was a night of steady watching,.- broken by many&#xD;
other thIngs, but not by sleep. There was constantly&#xD;
some little thing to do for the sick child,- ranging from&#xD;
giving him a drink of water, to giving him 'talk,' or rock~&#xD;
ing and-it might be-singing him to sleep.. But the&#xD;
&#xD;
 restless little requests never had to wait for their answer,&#xD;
k and with the whole house sunk in stillness or sleep, Mr.&#xD;
~ Linden played the part of a most gentle and efficient nurse&#xD;
~and thought of Faith, and her disappointment. And so&#xD;
the night wore away, and the morning star came up, and&#xD;
"~ then the red flushes of sunrise.&#xD;
"Who turneth tl~e night into day"..-.Mr. Linden thought,&#xD;
with a grave look from the window to the little face beside&#xD;
him-and then the ~Wprds came,-&#xD;
"In the morning, children, in the morning;&#xD;
We'll all rise together in the morning !"&#xD;
It was very early indeed, earlier even than usual, when&#xD;
Faith came down and kindled her fire. And then leaving&#xD;
it to burn, she opened the curtains of the window and&#xD;
looked out into the starlight. It was long before the red&#xD;
flush of the morning; it was e~cn before the time when&#xD;
Faith would have gone to relieve the guard in that sick&#xD;
room; her thoughts sped away to the distant catcherr there&#xD;
and the sick child. Faith could guess what sort of a&#xD;
watching it had been, and it was a comfort to think that&#xD;
Johnny had it. But then as she looked out into the clear&#xD;
still starlight, something brought up the question, what if&#xD;
Johnny should die ?-It was overwhelming to Faith for&#xD;
a minute; her little scholar's loveliness had got fast hold&#xD;
of her heart; and she loved him for deep and far-back&#xD;
associations too. She could not bear to think that it might&#xD;
be I et she asked herself if this was a reasonable feeling?&#xD;
Why should she be sorry7-if it were so-that this littIQ&#xD;
~ blossom of Heaven should have an early transplanting,&#xD;
thither? Ah, the fragrance of such lleaven4lowers is too&#xD;
~ sweet to be missed, and Earth wants them. As Faith&#xD;
looked sadly out into the night, watched the eternal prices~&#xD;
sion ot~ bright stars, and heard the low sweep of. the wind,&#xD;
the words came to her,-scparated from their context and&#xD;
from everything else as it seemed, - ' I, the Lord, do all&#xD;
these things.' 11cr mind as instantly gave a glad assent and&#xD;
rested itself in them. Not seen by her or by mortal the&#xD;
place or fitting of any change or turn of earthly things, in&#xD;
the great plan,-every one such turn and change had its&#xD;

place, as sure as the post of each star in the sky-as true&#xD;
to its commission as that wind, which came from no one&#xD;
knew where to go no one knew whither. Faith looked arid&#xD;
listened, and took the lesson deep down in her heart.&#xD;
Mr. Linden's little basket had stood him well in stead&#xD;
that long night,-for Faith had said truth; nothing was for&#xD;
him in Mr. Fax's house. Mr. Fax was well enough satis-&#xD;
fied that Johnny's teacher should take the trouble of nurs-&#xD;
ing the child, had no idea that such trouble would necessa.&#xD;
rily involve much loss of sleep, and still further no notion&#xD;
of the fact that a watcher at night needs food as much as&#xD;
fire. Fire Mr. Linden had, but he would have been worse&#xD;
off without the stores he found in his basket. In truth the&#xD;
supply generally was sufficient to have kept him from starv-&#xD;
ing even if he had been obliged to go without his breakfast;&#xD;
but Dr. Harrison concerned himself about his little patient,&#xD;
and was better than M~. Linden's hopes. He came,&#xD;
though in the cold short February morning, a good while&#xD;
before eight o'clock. lie gave Mr. Linden a pleasant clasp&#xD;
of the hand; and then made his observations in silence.&#xD;
"Is this one of your favourites ?" he said at length.&#xD;
A grave "yes."&#xD;
"I am sorry' for iL"&#xD;
Mr. Linden was silent at first, looking down at the child&#xD;
with a sort of expression the doctor had not often seen, and&#xD;
when he spoke it was without raising his eyes.&#xD;
"Tell me more particularly."&#xD;
"I don't know myself,"-said the doctor with a frankness&#xD;
startling in one of his profession; but Dr. Harrison's char-&#xD;
acteristk~ carelessness nowhere made itself more apparent&#xD;
than in his words and about what people might think of&#xD;
them.-." I don't say anything certain ly-but I do not like&#xD;
appearances."&#xD;
~ "What is the matter ?"&#xD;
"It's an indefinite sort of attack-.all the worse for that!&#xD;
-the root of which is hid from me. All you can do is&#xD;
to watch and wait. Have you been here through the&#xD;
night?"&#xD;
"Yes," Mr. Linden answered.-and put the further ques-&#xD;
tion, "Do you think there is any danger of contagion I"'&#xD;
"0 no! .-...the fevei~', what there is, comes from some&#xD;
&#xD;
inward cause-a complicated one, I judge. I can guess,&#xD;
and that's all. Are there no women about the house ?"&#xD;
"None that are good for much." And looking at his&#xD;
watch, Mr. Linden laid the child-.who had fallen asleep&#xD;
again-out of his arms among the pillows, arranging them&#xD;
softly and dextronsly as if he were used to the business.&#xD;
"Reuben Taylor will stay with him for the present," he&#xD;
said as he turned to Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
"I'll come again by and by," the doctor said. "Mean.&#xD;
while all that can be done is to let him have this, as I told&#xD;
you."&#xD;
The directions were given to Reuben, the doctor drove&#xD;
off, and Mr. Linden set out on his quick walk home; after&#xD;
the confinement of the night, the cold morning air and&#xD;
exercise were rather resting than otherwise. It was a very&#xD;
thoughtful half hour-very sorrowful at first; but before&#xD;
he reached home, thought, and almost feeling, had got&#xD;
beyond 'the narrow bounds of time,' and were resting&#xD;
peacefully-even joyfully.-.' where bright celestial ages&#xD;
roll.'&#xD;
He entered the house with a light step, and went first&#xD;
upstairs to change his dress; but when he came down and&#xD;
entered the sitting-room, there was the tone of I~he whole&#xD;
walk upon his face still. Faith put her question softly, as&#xD;
if she expected no glad answer. And yet it was partly&#xD;
that, though given in very gentle, grave tones.&#xD;
"There is more to fear than to hope, dear Faith,-and.&#xD;
there is everything to hope, and nothing to fear 1"&#xD;
She turned away. to the breakfast-table; and said little&#xD;
more till the meal was over. Then she rose when he did.&#xD;
"I am going now, Endy !"-The tone was of very earnest&#xD;
determination, that yet waited for sanction.&#xD;
"Yes," he answered-" Dr. Harrison says the fever is not&#xD;
contagious,-I waited to know that. If I can I shall get&#xD;
free before midday, so I may meet you there. And can&#xD;
you prepare and take with you two or three things ?"-he&#xD;
told her what.&#xD;
Faith set about them; .and when they were done, Mr.&#xD;
Skip had finished his breakfast and got Jerry ready. Some&#xD;
other preparations Faith had made beforehand; and with&#xD;
no delay now she was on her swift way to little Johnny's&#xD;

bedside. She came in like a Vision of comfort upon the&#xD;
sick room, with all sorts of freshness about her; grasped&#xD;
Reuben's hand, and throwing back her hood, stooped her&#xD;
lips to Johnny's cheek. And Johnny gave her his usual&#xD;
little fair smile-and then his eyes went off tothe doorway,&#xD;
as if he half expected to Lee some one else behind her. But&#xD;
it was from no want of love to her, as she knew from the&#xD;
way the eyes came back to her face and rested there, and&#xD;
took a sort of pleased survey of her hood and her fur and&#xD;
her dress.&#xD;
"Dear Johnny ! - Can you speak to me ?" said Faith&#xD;
tenderly touching her cheek again to his.&#xD;
"Oh~ yes, ma'am," he said, in a quiet voice and with the&#xD;
same bit of a smile. That was what Faith wanted. Then&#xD;
she looked up.&#xD;
"Are you going to school now, Reuben ?"&#xD;
"I didn't expect to this morning, Miss Faith," Reuben&#xD;
said with a sober glance athis little comrade.&#xD;
"Then you can wait here a bit for me."&#xD;
Leaving Reuben once more 'in charge? F aith went on a&#xD;
rummaging expedition over the house to find some woman&#xD;
inmate. Not too easily or speedily she. was found at last,&#xD;
the housekeeper and all-work woman, deep in all work as&#xD;
she really seemed., and in an outer kitchen of remote busi-&#xD;
ness, whither Faith had traced her by an exercise of deter-&#xD;
minate patience and skill. Having got so far, Faith was&#xD;
not balked in the rest; and obtaining from her some of&#xD;
Johnny's clean linen which she persuaded her to go in search&#xD;
of; she returned to the room where she had left Reuben;&#xD;
and set about making the sick child as comfortable as in his&#xD;
silliness he could be.&#xD;
It was a day or two already since Johnny had lain there&#xD;
and had had little effectual attention from anybody, till Mr.&#xD;
Linden came last night. The child might well look at his&#xD;
new nurse, for her neat dress and gentle face and soft move-&#xD;
ments were alone a balm for any sick place. And in her&#xD;
quiet way, Faith set about changing the look of this one.&#xD;
There was plenty of wood, and she made a glorious fire.&#xD;
Then tenderly and dextrously she managed to get a fresh&#xD;
nightgown on Johnny without disturbing him more than&#xD;
pleasantly with her soft manipulations; and wrapping him&#xD;

in a nice little old doublegown which she had brought with&#xD;
her and which had becit a friend of her own childish days,&#xD;
Faith gave him to Reuben to hold while she made up the&#xD;
bed and changed the clothes, the means for which she had&#xD;
als~ won from the housekeeper. Then having let down the&#xD;
chintz curtains to shield off the intense glare of the sunny&#xD;
snow, Faith assnr~cd Johnny into her own arms. She had&#xD;
brought vinegar from home, and with it bathed the little&#xD;
boy's face and hands and brushed his hair, till the refreshed&#xD;
little head lay upon her breast in soothed rest and comfort.&#xD;
"There, Johnny !".-she whispered as her lips touched&#xD;
his brow,.-" Mr. Linden may come as soon as he pleases-.--.&#xD;
we are ready for him !"&#xD;
The child half enclosed his eyes at the words, and then&#xD;
sunk again into one of his fits of feverish sleep, the colour&#xD;
rising in his cheeks a little, the breath coming quick.&#xD;
Reuben knel/~ down at Faith's side and watched him.&#xD;
"I used to wonder, Miss Faith," he said softly, "what&#xD;
would become of him if Mr. Linden ever went away"-and&#xD;
the quiet pause told what provision iReuben thought was&#xD;
fast coming for any such conthigency.&#xD;
"You can't think what Mr. Linden's been to Johnny,&#xD;
Miss Faith," he went on in the same low voice,-" and to&#xD;
all of us," he added lower still. "But he's taken such care&#xD;
of him, in school and out. It was only last week Johnny&#xD;
told me he liked coining to school in the winter, because&#xD;
then Mr. Linden always went home with him. And when-&#xD;
ever he could get in Mr. Linden's lap he was perfectly&#xD;
happy. And Mr. Linden would let him, sometimes, even&#xD;
in school, because Johnny was so little and not very strong,&#xD;
-and he'd let him sit in his lap and go to sleep for a little&#xD;
while when he got tired, and then Johnny would go back&#xD;
to his lessons as bright as a bee. That was the way he did&#xD;
~i' the very first day school was opened, for Johnny was&#xD;
frightened at first, and a mind to cry-he'd never had any-&#xD;
body to take much care of him. And Mr. Linden just&#xD;
called him and took him up and spoke to him--and Johnny&#xD;
laid his head right down and went to sleep; and he's loved&#xD;
Mr. Linden with all his heart ever since. I know we ~all&#xD;
laughed~.-and he smiled himself; but it made all the restof&#xD;
us love him too."&#xD;

"first day school was opened !".-how Faith's thoughts&#xD;
sprang back there,-with what strange, mixed memories&#xD;
the vision of it came. up before her! That day and time&#xD;
when so many new threads were introduced into her life,&#xD;
which were now showing their colours and working out&#xD;
their various patterns. It was only a spring there and&#xD;
back again, however, that her thoughts took; 4r rather&#xD;
the vision was a sort of background to Reuben's decline.&#xD;
tions, and her eye was upon these; with what kind of sym.&#xD;
pathy she did not care to let him see. Her cheek was&#xD;
bent down to the sick child's head and Faith's face was&#xD;
half hidden. Until a moment later, when tub door opened&#xD;
and Johnny's father came in to see what was become of him;&#xD;
and then Mr. Fax had no clue to the lustrous softness of&#xD;
the eyes that looked up at him. He could make nothing&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
"What!" said he. "Why who's Johnny got to look&#xD;
after him now ?"&#xD;
"I am his teacher, sir."&#xD;
"His teacher, be you? Seems to me he's a lot of 'em.&#xD;
One teacher stayed with him last night. How many has he&#xD;
got, among you ?"&#xD;
"Only two-" said Faith, rejoicing that she was one. "I&#xD;
am his Sunday school teacher."&#xD;
"Well what's your name, now ?"&#xD;
"Faith Derrick."&#xD;
"That's who you be !" said Mr. Fax in surprise. "Don't&#xD;
say! Well Johnny's got into good hands, aint lie? How's&#xD;
he getting' along ?"&#xD;
Faith's eye went down to the little boy, and her hand&#xD;
passed slowly and tenderly over his hair; she was at a loss&#xD;
liow to answer, and Reuben spoke for her.&#xD;
"He's been sleeping a good deal this morning."&#xD;
The father stooped towards the child, but his look went&#xD;
from him to Faith, with a mixture of curiosity and un-&#xD;
easiness as he spoke.&#xD;
"Sleepin', is he ?.-.Then I guess he's getting' along first-&#xD;
x~ate-aint he ?"&#xD;
Again Faith's look astonished the man, both because of&#xD;
&#xD;
its intent softauty and the trembling set of her lip. lint&#xD;
how to answer him she did not know~ Her head sunk over&#xD;
the child's brow as she exclaimed,&#xD;
"His dear Master knows what to do with him!"&#xD;
Jonathan Fax stood up straight and looked at Reuben.&#xD;
"What does she mean&#xD;
'~ She means that he is in G-od7s hands, and that we&#xD;
don't; know yet what He will do," Reuben answered with&#xD;
clear simplicity.&#xD;
Yet it was a strange view of the subject to Mr. Fax;&#xD;
and he stood stiff' and angular and square, looking down&#xD;
at Faith and her charge, feeling startled and strange. Her&#xD;
face was bent so that he could not see that quiver of her&#xD;
lip now; but he did see one or two drops fall from the&#xD;
lowered eyelids qn Johnny's hair. Perhaps he would have&#xD;
asked more questions, but he did not; something kept&#xD;
them back. He stood fixed, with gathering soberness*&#xD;
growing over his features. Little he guessed that those&#xD;
tears had been half wrung from Faith's eyes by the contrast&#xD;
between his happy little child and him. It was with some~&#xD;
thing like a groan at last that he turned away, merely bid.&#xD;
ding Reuben Taylor t6 call for anything that was wanted.&#xD;
The morning wore on softly, for Johnny still slept.&#xD;
Reuben went quietly about, giving attention where it was&#xD;
needed; to the fire, or to the curtains-drawn back now&#xD;
as the sun got round-or bringing Faith a footstool, or&#xD;
trying some other little thing for her comfort; and when&#xD;
he was not wanted remaining in absolute stillness. As it&#xD;
neared midday, however, he took his stand by the window,&#xD;
and after a short watch there suddenly turned and left the&#xD;
room. And a moment after Mr. Linden came in.&#xD;
Faith met him with a look of grave, sweet quiet; in&#xD;
which was mingled a certain joy at being where she was.&#xD;
She waited for him to speak. But something in her face,&#xD;
or her office, moved him,-the gravity of his own look&#xD;
deepened as he came forward-his words were not ready.&#xD;
He sat down by her, resting his arm on the back of her&#xD;
chair and giving her and Johnny the same salutation-the&#xD;
last too softly to rouse him.&#xD;
"Has the doctor been here ?" he said first.&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;

&#xD;
He was silent again for a minute, but then Johnny sud.&#xD;
denly started up-waking perhaps out of some fever dream;&#xD;
for he seemed frightened and bewildered, and almost ready&#xD;
to cry; turning his head uneasily away from everything&#xD;
and everybody as it seemed, until his eyes were fairly open,&#xD;
and then giving almost a spring out of Faith's arms into&#xD;
those of Mr. Linden; holding him round the neck and&#xD;
breathing little sobbing breaths on his shoulder, till the&#xD;
resting-place had done its, work, -till Mr. Linden's soft&#xD;
whispered words had given him comfort. But it was a&#xD;
little wearily then that he said, "Sing."&#xD;
Was it wearily that the song was given? Faith could&#xD;
not tell,.......she could not name those different notes in the&#xD;
voice,-she could only feel that the octave reached from&#xD;
earth to heaven..&#xD;
"'how kind is Jesus, Lord of all!&#xD;
To hear my little feeble call.&#xD;
How kind is Jesus, thus to be&#xD;
Physici~a, Saviour, all to me!&#xD;
'How much he loves me he doth shew;&#xD;
How much he loves I cannot know.&#xD;
I'm glad my life is his to keep,&#xD;
Then he will watch and I may sleep&#xD;
'Jesus on earth, while here .1 lie;&#xD;
Jesus in heaven, if I die:&#xD;
I'm safe and happy in his care,&#xD;
his love will keep me, here or there.&#xD;
'An angel he may send for me,&#xD;
And then an angel I shall be.&#xD;
Lord Jesus, through thy love divine,&#xD;
Thy little child is ever thine.'"&#xD;
Faith had drawn her chair a little back and with her&#xD;
head leaning on the back of Mr. Linden's chair, listened-&#xD;
in a spirit not very different from Johnny's own. She&#xD;
looked up then when it was done, with almost as childlike&#xD;
a brow. It had quieted him, as with a charm, and the&#xD;
little smile he gave Faith was almost wondering why she&#xD;
looked grave.&#xD;
"You've been here a good while," he said, as if the mere&#xD;
announcement of the fact spoke his thanks.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Has she ?" Mr. Linden said. "What has Miss Faith&#xD;
done with you, Johnny, if she has been here a good&#xD;
while ?"&#xD;
"All sorts of things," 1Joh nny answered, with another&#xD;
comprehensive expression of gratitude.&#xD;
"I thought so. !" said Mr. Linden. "I shouldn't wonder&#xD;
a bit if she had dressed ~ou up in something she used to&#xD;
wear herself."&#xD;
"She wasn't ever so little," the child said softly.&#xD;
Faith had been preparing for him ~a cup of some light&#xD;
nourishment which he was to take from time to time, and&#xD;
now coming to Mr. Linden's side kneeled down there before&#xD;
Johnny to give it to him. The child took the delicate&#xD;
spoonfuls as she gave them, turning his fair eyes from her&#xD;
to Mr. Linden as if he felt in a very sweet atmosphere of&#xD;
love and care; and when she went away with the cup he&#xD;
said in his slow fashion,&#xD;
"I love her very much."&#xD;
And Faith heard the answer-&#xD;
"And so do I."&#xD;
Coming up behind Mr. Linden she laid her hand on his&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
"Endecott.-..where are you going to take dinner and&#xD;
rest to-day ?"&#xD;
"0 I will take rest by the way," he answered lightly,&#xD;
and with a smile at her. "There is dinner enough in my&#xD;
supper basket-I have not much time for it, neither."&#xD;
"School again this afternoon ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I must be there for awhile."&#xD;
Faith moved baway, remarking in a different tone, "Your&#xD;
supper basket is at home, sir !"-and busied her energies&#xD;
about serving him as she had just served Johnny. With&#xD;
something more substantial however. Faith had brought&#xD;
a lunch basket, and in five minutes had made Mr. Linden&#xD;
a cup of home tea.&#xD;
"Now how shall we manage ~" she said ;.-." for Johnny&#xD;
must have you every minute while you are here-..and&#xD;
tnere is no such thing as a little table. I shall have to&#xD;
be table and dumb waiter for you-~--if you won't mind."&#xD;
And so Faith pulled up her chair again and sat* down,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8220-00000053"/>&#xD;
104&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
with the basket open on her lap and Mr. Linden's cup in~&#xD;
her hand.&#xD;
"~ only hope," she said, "that Dr. Harrison will not&#xD;
choose this particular minute to come in! If he does,&#xD;
catch the cup of tea, Endecott !-for I won't answer for&#xD;
anything."&#xD;
"I don't know whether I should be most sorry or proud,&#xD;
in case of such event," said Mr. Linden,-~." however, I do&#xD;
not wish the doctor anything so disagreeable. But I will&#xD;
promise to catch the cup of tea-and everything else, down&#xD;
to his displeasure. Only you must not be a~ dumb waiter,&#xD;
for that will not suit me at all."&#xD;
It was one of those pretty bits of sunshine that some-&#xD;
times shew themselves in the midst of a very unpromising&#xD;
day, the time when they sat there with the lunch basket&#xD;
between them. The refreshment of talk and of lunch (for&#xD;
lunch is refreshing when it is needed) brightened both&#xD;
faces. and voices; and Mr. Linden's little charge, in one of&#xD;
his turns of happy rest and ease, watched them-amused&#xD;
and interested-till he fell asleep. By that time Mr.&#xD;
Linden's spare minutes were about over. As he was&#xD;
laying Johnny gently down on the bed, Faith seized her&#xD;
chance.&#xD;
"You'll let me stay here to-night--won't you, Ende~&#xD;
cott ?"&#xD;
"It would not be good for you, dear child,-if you stay&#xD;
until night it will be quite as much as you ought to do. But&#xD;
I xviii se~ you again by that time."&#xD;
"I am strong, Endecott."&#xD;
"Yes, you are strong, little Sunbeam," he said, turning&#xD;
now to her and taking both her hands,~-.--" and yet it is a&#xD;
sort of strength I must guard. Even sunbeams must not&#xD;
be always on duty. But we'll see about it when I come&#xD;
back."&#xD;
Mr. Linden went off to his other sphere of action, and&#xD;
soon after Reuben came softly in, just to let Faith know&#xD;
that he was at ha~nd if she wanted anything, and to offer to&#xD;
take her place.&#xD;
"Reuben !" said Faith suddenly, "have you had any&#xD;
dinner ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                105&#xD;
"0 yes, ma'am-enough," Reuben said with a smile.&#xD;
"I brought something with me this morning."&#xD;
Faith put her lunch basket into his hand, but her words&#xD;
were cut short; for she saw Dr. Harrison just coming to&#xD;
the house. She moved away and stood gravely by the&#xD;
fire.&#xD;
The doctor came in pulling off his glove. He gave his&#xD;
hand to Faith with evident pleasure, but with a frank free&#xD;
pleasure, that had nothing embarrassing about the manner&#xD;
of it; except the indication of its depth. After a few&#xD;
words given with as easy an intonation as if the the~~&#xD;
monieter were not just a few degrees above zero outside~&#xD;
where he had come froth, the doctor's eye went over to th6&#xD;
other person in the room; and then the doctor himself&#xD;
crossed over and offered his hand.&#xD;
"I shall never see you, Reuben,"-said he with a very&#xD;
pleasant recollective play of eye and lip,.-.-" without think-&#xD;
ing of a friend."&#xD;
The doctor had a more full view of Reuben's eyes, there-&#xD;
upon, than he had ever before been favoured with,-for one&#xD;
moment their clear, true, earnest expression met his. But&#xD;
whatever the boy read.-.or tried to read-or did not read,&#xD;
he answered simply, as he looked away again,&#xD;
"You have been that to me, sir."&#xD;
"I don't know-" said the doctor lightly. "I am afraid&#xD;
not according to your friend Mr. Linden's definition. But&#xD;
reckon me such a one as I can be, will you ?"-lle turned&#xD;
away without waiting for the answer and went back to&#xD;
Faith.&#xD;
"Do you know," he said, "I expected to find you&#xD;
here ?"&#xD;
"Very naturally," said Faith quietly.&#xD;
"Yes-it is according to my experience. "Now how is&#xD;
this child ?"-.&#xD;
He turned to see, and so did Faith. He looked at the&#xD;
child, while Faith's eye went from Johnny to him. Both&#xD;
faces were grave, but Faith's grew more grave as she&#xD;
looked.&#xD;
"How is this child ?" she repeated.&#xD;
"He is not worse," said the doctor; "except that not to&#xD;

&#xD;
be better is to be worse. Are you particularly interested&#xD;
in him?"&#xD;
Faith looked down at the sweet pure little face, and for&#xD;
a minute or two was very still. She did not even think of&#xD;
answering the doctor, nor dare speak words at all. Her&#xD;
first movement was to push away softly a lock of hair from&#xD;
Johnny's forehead.&#xD;
"What can I do for him, Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
"Not much just now-go on as you have been doing. I&#xD;
will be here to-night again, and then perhaps I shall know&#xD;
more."&#xD;
He gave her a new medicine for him however; and having&#xD;
said all that was needful on that score, came back with her&#xD;
to the fire and stood a little while talking-just so long as&#xD;
it would do for him to stay with any chance of its being ac-&#xD;
ceptable; talking in a tone that did not jar with the place or&#xD;
the time, gravely and pleasantly, of some matters of&#xD;
interest; and then he went. And. Faith sat down by the&#xD;
bedside, and forgot Dr. Harrison; and thought of the Sun.&#xD;
day school in the woods that evening in October, and the&#xD;
hymn,' I want to be an angel'; and looke~l at Johnny with&#xD;
every full heart.&#xD;
Not a very long time had passed, when Faith heard&#xD;
sleigh bells again, and a person very different from the&#xD;
doctor came softly in; even Mrs. Derrick. She smiled at&#xD;
Reuben and Faith, and going close up to the bed folded her&#xD;
hands quietly together and stood looking at the sick child;&#xD;
the smile vanishing from her face, her lips taking a tender,&#xD;
pitiful set-her eyes in their experience~gravely reading the&#xD;
signs. She looked for a few minutes in silence, then with a&#xD;
little sorrowful sigh she turned to Faith.&#xD;
"Pretty child," she said, "can't you take a little rest?&#xD;
I'll sit~h3 him now."&#xD;
"0 mother I'm not tired-much. I have not been very&#xD;
busy."&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick however took the matter into her own&#xD;
hands, and did not content herself till she had Faith on a&#xD;
low seat at her side, and Faith's head on her lap; which&#xD;
was a rest, to mind and body both. Reuben replenished&#xD;
the fire and went out, and the two sat alone.&#xD;
"Faith," her mother said softly, ." don't you think he'd&#xD;
&#xD;
be content with me to-night? I can't bear to have Mr..&#xD;
Linden sit up."&#xD;
"I want to stay myself, mother, if he would let me."&#xD;
"I don't believe he'll do that, Faith-and I guess he's&#xD;
right. But you must make him go home to tea, child, and&#xD;
he might rest a little then; and I'll stay till he comes back,&#xD;
at least."&#xD;
There was not much more to be said then, for Johnny&#xD;
woke up and wanted to be taken on Faith'slap, and talked&#xD;
to, and petted; answering all her efforts with a sort of&#xD;
grateful little smile and way; but moving himself about in&#xD;
her arms as If he felt restless and uneasy. It went to her&#xD;
heart Presently, in the low tones which were music&#xD;
of themselves, she carried his thoughts off to the time&#xD;
when Jesus was a little child; and began to give him, in&#xD;
the simplicity of very graphic detail, part of the story of&#xD;
Christ's life upon earth. It was a name that Johnny loved&#xD;
to hear; and Faith went from point to point of his words,&#xD;
and wonders, and healing power and comforting love. Not&#xD;
dwelling too long, but telling Johnny very much as if she&#xD;
had seen it, each gentle story of the sick and the weary.&#xD;
and the troubled, who came in their various ways to ask&#xD;
pity of Jesus, and found it; and reporting to Johnny as if&#xD;
she had heard them the words of promise and love that a&#xD;
little child could understand. Mrs. Derrick listened; she&#xD;
had never heard just such a talk in her life. The peculiarity.&#xD;
of it was in the vivid faith and love which took hold of the&#xD;
things as if Faith had had them by eyesight and hearing,&#xD;
and in the simplicity of representation with which she&#xD;
gave them, as a child to a child. And all the while she&#xD;
let Johnny constantly be changing his position, as restles~..&#xD;
ness prompted; from sitting to kneeling, and lying in her&#xD;
arms; sometimes brushing his hair, which o~ce in a while&#xD;
he h~d a fancy for, and sometimes combing it off from his&#xD;
forehead with her own fingers dipped In the vinegar and&#xD;
water which he liked to smell. Nothing could be more&#xD;
winning-nothing more skilful, in its way, than Faith's talk&#xD;
to the sick' child that half hour or more. And Johnny told&#xD;
its effect, in the way he would bid her 'talk,' if she paused&#xD;
for a minute. So by degrees the restless fit passed off for&#xD;

&#xD;
the time, and he lay still in her arms, with drooping heavy&#xD;
eyelids now.&#xD;
Everything was subsiding ;-the sun sank down softly&#xD;
behind the wavy horizon line, the clouds floated silently&#xD;
away to some other harbour, and the blasts of wind came&#xD;
fainter and fainter, like the music of a retreating army.&#xD;
Swiftly the daylight ebbed away, and still Faith rocked&#xD;
softly back and forth, and her mother watched her. Once&#xD;
in a while Reuben came silently in to bring wood or fresh&#xD;
water, -otherwise they had no interruption. Then Mr.&#xD;
Linden came, and sitting down by Faith as he had done&#xD;
before, asked about the child and about the doctor.&#xD;
"lie came very soon after you went away," said Faith.&#xD;
"He said that he was no better, and that to be no better&#xD;
was to be worse." It was plain that she thought more than&#xD;
she said. Faith had little experience, but there is an intui-&#xD;
tive skill in some eyes to know what they have never known&#xD;
before.&#xD;
Mr. Linden bent down over the child, laying cheek to&#xD;
cheek softly and silently, until Johnny rousing up a little&#xD;
held up his lips to be kissed,-and he did not raise his head&#xD;
then.&#xD;
"Have you been asleep, Johnny ?" he said.&#xD;
"I don't know," the child said dreamily.&#xD;
"Has Miss Faith taken care of you ever since I went&#xD;
away ?"&#xD;
"Yes," Johnny said, with a little faint smile .-." and&#xD;
we've had talk."&#xD;
"I wish I had been here to hear it," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"What was it about ?-all sorts of sweet things ?"&#xD;
"Yes," Johnny said again, his face brightening-.-" out&#xD;
of the Bible."&#xD;
"Well they are the sweetest things I know of," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden. "Now if you will come on my lap, I am sure&#xD;
Miss Faith will get you something to eat-she can do it a&#xD;
great deal better than I can."&#xD;
Faith had soon done that, and brought the cup to&#xD;
Johnny, of something that he liked, and fed him as she had&#xD;
done at noon. It seemed to refresh him, for he fell into a&#xD;
quieter sleep, than he had had for some time, and was&#xD;
softly laid on the bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now clear Faith," Mr. Linden said coming back to her,&#xD;
"it is time for 'you to go home and rest."&#xD;
"Do you mean to ,send me?" she said wistfully.&#xD;
"Or take you-" he said, with a soft touch of his fingers&#xD;
on her hair. "I don't know but I could be spared long&#xD;
ei~ough for that."&#xD;
It was arranged so, Mrs. Derrick undertaking to supply&#xD;
all deficiencies so far as she could, until Mr. Linden should&#xD;
get back again. The fast drive honie through the still cold&#xD;
air was refreshing to both parties; it was a still drive too.&#xD;
Then leaving Mr. Linden to get a little rest on the sofa,&#xD;
Faith prepared tea. But Mr. Linden would not stay long&#xD;
after that, for rest or anything.&#xD;
"I am coming very early to-morrow, Endecott," Faith&#xD;
said then.&#xD;
"You may, dear child.-.-if you will promise to sleep to~&#xD;
night. But you must not rouse yourself too early. You.&#xD;
know to-morrow is Saturday~so I shall not be called off&#xD;
by other duties."&#xD;
lie went, and Mrs. Derrick cameo l.j&#xD;
weary enough certainly, spent the ' ut Faith, though&#xD;
evening in study.&#xD;

CHAPTER WILL&#xD;
~IIERE is no knowing what Mr. Linden would have&#xD;
considered "too early," and Faith had prudently&#xD;
omi~pd to enquirer ' She studied nothing but her Bible&#xD;
that horning and speiit the rest of the time in getting&#xD;
ready what she was to take with her; for Mr. Linden&#xD;
would not come home to breakfast. And it was but fair&#xD;
day, the sun had not risen, when she was on her way. She&#xD;
wondered,. as she went, what they would have done that&#xD;
winter wit.h out Jerry; and looked at the coloring clouds&#xD;
in the east with a strange quick appreciation of the rising&#xD;
of that other day told of in the Bible. Little Johnny&#xD;
brought the two near; the type and the antitype. it was&#xD;
a' pretty ride; cold, bright, still, shadowless; till the sun&#xD;
got above the horizon, and then the long yellow faint&#xD;
beams threw themselves gross the snow that was all a&#xD;
white level before. They reached Faith's heart, as the&#xD;
commissioned earnest of that other Sun that will fil1~ the&#xD;
world with his glory and that will make heaven a place&#xD;
where "there shall be no night."&#xD;
The room where little Johnny was, lay-like the chamber&#xD;
called Peace,. in the Pilgrim's Progress-towards the sun-&#xD;
rising; but to reach it Faith had first to pass through&#xD;
another on the darker side of the house. The door be.&#xD;
tween the two stood open, perhaps for fresher air, and as&#xD;
Faith came lightly in she could see that room lit up as it&#xD;
w~re with the early sunbeams. It was an old-fashioned&#xD;
room ;-the windows with chintz shades, the floor painted,&#xD;
with a single strip of rag carpet; the old low-post bed-&#xD;
stead, with its check blue and white spread, the high-backed&#xD;
splinter chairs, told of life that had made but little progress&#xD;
in modern improvement. And 3 onathan Fax himself, lean,&#xD;
long-headed, ~nd lantern-jawed, looked grimmer than ever&#xD;
under his new veil of solemn feeling. He sat by the win-&#xD;
dow.&#xD;
The wood fire in the low fireplace flickered and fell with&#xD;
(110)&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
its changing light, on all; but within the warm glow a little&#xD;
group told of life that had made progress-progress which&#xD;
though but yet begun, was to go on its fair course through&#xD;
all the ages of eternity!&#xD;
Little Johnny sat in his teacher's lap, one arm round&#xD;
hi~ neck, and his weary little head resting as securely on&#xD;
Mr. Linden's breast as if it had been a woman's. The&#xD;
other hand moved softly' over the cuff of that black sleeve,&#xD;
or twined its thin fingers in and out the strong hand that&#xD;
was clasped round him. Sometimes raising his eyes, Johnny&#xD;
put some question, or asked for "talk ;" his own face then&#xD;
much the brighter of the two,.-.-Faith could see the face&#xD;
that bent over him not only touched with its wanted gravity,&#xD;
which the heavenly seal set there, but moved and shaken&#xD;
in its composure by the wistful eyes and words of the little&#xD;
boy. The answering words were too low-spoken for her to&#xD;
hear. She could see how tenderly the child's caresses were&#xD;
returned,-not the mother whose care Johnny had never&#xD;
known, could have given the little head gentler rest. Nay,&#xD;
not so good, ~unless she could. have given the little heart&#xD;
such comfort. For Johnny was in the arms of one who&#xD;
knew well that road to the. unseen land-who had studied&#xD;
it; and now as the child went on before him, could still&#xD;
give him words of cheer, and shew him the stepping-stones&#xD;
through the dark river. It seemed to Faith as if the river&#xD;
were already in sight,-as if somewhat of&#xD;
"that strange, unearthly grace&#xD;
Which crowns but once the children of our race__"&#xD;
already rested upon Johnny's fair brow. Yet he looked&#xD;
brighter than yesterday,-.bright with a very sweet clear&#xD;

I~kPth stood still oneminute-and another; then pulling&#xD;
off her hood, she came in with a footfall so noiseless that&#xD;
it never brou~~ht Mr. Fax's head from the window, ~nd&#xD;
knelt, down by the side of that group. She had a smile&#xD;
for Johnny too, but it was a smile that had quite left the&#xD;
things of the world behind it a~d met the child on his own&#xD;
ground; and her kiss was sweet accordingly. A. look and a&#xD;
clasp of the hand to Mr. Linden; then she rose up and&#xD;

&#xD;
went round to the window to take the hand of Mr. Fax;&#xD;
who had found his feet.&#xD;
"I'm very much beholden to ye !" said he in somewhat&#xD;
astonished wise.. "You're takin' a sight o' trouble among&#xD;
ye. It's no trouble, sir."&#xD;
Mr. Fax looked bewildered. H~ advanced to Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den. "Now this girl's here," said he, "don't you think&#xD;
you hadn't better come into another room and try to drop&#xD;
off? I guess he can get along without you for a spell...-..&#xD;
can't he P'&#xD;
"1 am not quite ready to leave him," Mr. Linden said7-.&#xD;
"and I am not at all sleepy, Mr. Fax. Perhaps I will come&#xD;
by and by."&#xD;
"'We'll have breakfast, I conclude, some time this fore.&#xD;
noon. I'll go and see if it's ever comm'. Maybe you'll&#xD;
take that first."&#xD;
He went away; and Faith7 rid of her wrappers, came&#xD;
up again behind Johnny, passing her fingers through his&#xD;
h~ir and bending down her face to his; she did not speak.&#xD;
Only her eye went to Mr. Linden for intelligence, as the&#xD;
eye will, even when it has seen for itself!&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison is coming this morning," was all he said.&#xD;
She did not need to ask any more.&#xD;
'~'May Johnny have anything now&#xD;
"0 yes-and he will like it," Mr. Linden said in a dif-&#xD;
ferent tone, and half addressing the child. "He asked me&#xD;
some time ago when you were coming - but not for&#xD;
that."&#xD;
Faith brought something freshly prepared for Johnny&#xD;
and served him tenderly. Meanwhile her own coffee had&#xD;
been on the fire; and after making two or three simple&#xD;
arrangements of things she came back to them.&#xD;
"Will you sit with me now, Johnny, and let Mr. Linden&#xD;
have some breakfastt"&#xD;
"In here ?" the child said. But being reassured on that&#xD;
point, he came to Faith's arms very willingly, or rather let&#xD;
Mr. Linden place him there, when she~had drawn her chair&#xD;
up nearer the table so that he could look on. And with&#xD;
her a\n s wrapped tenderly round him, but a face of as clear&#xD;
quiet ,~is the~ iqorning sky when there are no clouds before&#xD;
&#xD;
the sunrise, she sat there, and she and JohAny watched Mr.&#xD;
Linden's breakfast. There was no need to talk, for Johnny&#xD;
had a simple pleasure in what was going on, and in every-.&#xD;
thing his friend did. And if the little face before him&#xD;
hiiidered Mr. Linden's enjoyment of breakfast, that ~was&#xD;
suffered to appear as little as possible. Breakfast was even&#xD;
rather prolonged and played with, because it seemed to&#xD;
amuse him; and the word and the smile were always ready,&#xD;
either to call forth or to answer one from the child. Nor&#xD;
from him alone, for by degrees even Faith was drawn out&#xD;
of her silence7 into genie quiet talk.&#xD;
Mi'. Linden had not yet changed his pkice, when on the&#xD;
walk that led up to the house Faith saw the approach of&#xD;
Di'. Harrison. The doctor as he came in gave a compre-&#xD;
hensive glance at the table, Mr. Linden who had risen, and&#xD;
Faith with Johnny in he.r lap; shook hands with Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den, and taking the chair he had quitted sat down in front&#xD;
of Faith and Johnny. A question and answer first passed&#xD;
about her own well-being.&#xD;
"You've not been here all night ?" said he.&#xD;
"No, sir. I came a while ago."&#xD;
The doctor's unsatisfied eye fell on the child; fell, with&#xD;
~o change of its unsatisfied expression. It took rapid and&#xD;
yet critical note .of him, with a look that Faith knew&#xD;
through its unchangingness, scanned, judged, and passed&#xD;
sentence. Then Dr. Harrison rose and walked over to Mr.&#xD;
Linden.&#xD;
"There is nothing to be done," he said in a low tone. "I&#xD;
would stay-but I know that it would be in vain. $he&#xD;
otwht not to be here."&#xD;
r the first remark Mr. Linden was prepared,-the&#xD;
secoiN.. fell upon~ a heart that was already keeping closer&#xD;
watch over her strength and happiness than even the doc..&#xD;
tor could. He merely answered by a. quiet question or&#xD;
two as to what could be done for the child's comfort-.&#xD;
as to the probable length of time there would be to do&#xD;
anything.&#xD;
"He may have any simple thing he likes," said the doc~&#xD;
toy-" such as he has had. I need not give you directions&#xD;
for more than to-day. I am sorry I can~1iQt stay longer&#xD;

&#xD;
with you-but it does not matter-you can do as well as j&#xD;
now."&#xD;
He went up to Faith and spoke with a difYorent manner,&#xD;
"Miss Faith, I hope you will not let your goodness forget&#xD;
that its powers need to be taken care of. You were here&#xD;
yesterday-there is no necessity for you to ho here to.&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"I don't come for necessity, Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"I know !" said he shaking h is head,.-"your will i~&#xD;
strong! but it ought not to have full play. You are ~&#xD;
wanted here."&#xD;
Faith let him go without an answer to that. As soon&#xD;
as the doctor wa~ gone, Mr. Linden came and sat down by&#xD;
Johnny again, kissing the child's brow and cheek and lips,&#xD;
with a face a little moved indeed, and yet with its clear&#xD;
look unclouded; and softly asked what he should do for&#xD;
him. But though Johnny smiled, and stroked his face, lie&#xD;
seemed rather inclined to he quiet and even to sleep;&#xD;
yielding partly to the effect of weakness and fever, partly&#xD;
to the restless night; and his two teachers watched him&#xD;
together. Faith was, very silent and quiet. Then sud~&#xD;
denly she said,&#xD;
"Go and take some rest yourself, won't you, Endeco~t-&#xD;
now."&#xD;
"I do not feel the need of it-" he said. "I had some&#xD;
snatches of sleep last night."&#xD;
She looked at him, but the silence was unbroken again&#xD;
for some little time longer. At length, pushing aside a&#xD;
lock of hair from the fair little brow beneath which the&#xD;
eyelids drooped with such unnatural heaviness, Faith said,&#xD;
.-.-and the tone seemed to come from very stillness of heart,&#xD;
the words dropped so grave and clear,-&#xD;
"The name of Christ is good here to-day, Endecott."&#xD;
"How good! how precious I" was his quick rejoinder.&#xD;
"And how very precious too, is the love of his will !"-aud&#xD;
he repeated softly, as if half thinking it out-.&#xD;
"'I worship thee, sweet will of God!&#xD;
And all thy ways adore!&#xD;
And every day I live, I seem&#xD;
To love thee more and more."'&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
An earnest, somewhat wistful glance of Faith's eye was&#xD;
the answer; it was not a~ dissenting answer, hut it went&#xD;
hack to Johnny. Her lip was a child's lip in its huinbie~&#xD;
neSS.&#xD;
"it was very hard for me to give him up at first-" Mr.&#xD;
Linden went on softly; and the voice said it was yet;&#xD;
"but that answers all questions. 'The good ilusbaudman&#xD;
may pluck his roses, and gather in his lilies at mid-summer,&#xD;
and, for aught I dare say, in the beginning of the first&#xD;
~nmmer         __&#xD;
Faith looked at the lWtle human flower in her arms-and&#xD;
was silent.&#xD;
"Reuben was telling me yesterday~~~ she said after a&#xD;
few minutes,-" what you have been to him."&#xD;
But her words touched sweet and bitter things-Mr.&#xD;
Linden did not immediately answer,-his head drooped a&#xD;
little on his hand, and he did not raise it again until Johnny&#xD;
claimed his attention.&#xD;
The quiet rest of the little sleeper was passing ~&#xD;
changing into an unquiet waking; not with the fear of&#xD;
yesterday but with a restlessness of discomfort that was&#xD;
not easily soothed. Words and caresses seemed to have&#xD;
lost their quieting power for the time, though the child's&#xD;
face never failed to answer them; but he presently held&#xD;
out his arms to Mr. Linden, with the words, "Walk-like&#xD;
last night."&#xD;
And for a while then Faith had nothing to do but to&#xD;
look and listen; to listen to the soft measured steps through&#xD;
the room, to watch the soothing, resting effect of the&#xD;
motion on the sick child, as wrapped in Mr. Linden's arms&#xD;
he was carried to and fro. She could tell how it wrought&#xD;
from the quieter, unbent muscles-from the words which&#xD;
by degrees Johnny began to speak. But after a while, one&#xD;
of these words was, "Sing. "-Mr. Linden did not stay his&#xD;
walk, but though his tone was almost as low as his foot-&#xD;
steps, Faith heard every word.&#xD;
"Jesus loves mo-this I know,&#xD;
For the Bible tells me so:&#xD;
Little ones to him belong,-&#xD;
'They are weak, but he is strong.&#xD;

SAY AND SEAL.           lIT&#xD;
&#xD;
11(3                  SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Jesus loves me,-he who died&#xD;
Heaven's gate to open wide;&#xD;
He will wash away my sin,&#xD;
Let his little child come in.&#xD;
r&#xD;
"Jesus loves me-loves me still,&#xD;
Though I'm very weak and ill;&#xD;
From his shining throne on high&#xD;
Comes to watch me where I lie.&#xD;
"Jesus loves me,---he will stay&#xD;
Close heside~me all the way.&#xD;
Then his little child will take&#xD;
Tip to heaven for his dear sake."&#xD;
There were a few silent turns taken after that, and thea&#xD;
Mr. Linden came back to the rocking-chair, and told Faith&#xD;
in a sort of bright cheerful way-meant for her as well as&#xD;
the child-that Johnny ivanted her to brush his hair and&#xD;
give him something to eat. Which Johnny enforced with&#xD;
one of his quiet smiles. Faith sprang to do it, and both&#xD;
offices were performed with hands of tenderness and eyes&#xD;
of love, with how much inner trembling of heart neither&#xD;
eyes nor hands told. Then, after all that was done, Faith&#xD;
stood by the table and. began to swallow coffee and bread&#xD;
on her own account, somewhat eagerly. Mr. Linden&#xD;
watched her, with grave eyes.&#xD;
"Now you must go and lie down," he said.&#xD;
"Not at all I" Faith said with a smile at him. "I&#xD;
hadn't time-or didn't take time-to eat my breakfast&#xD;
before I came away from home-that is all. It is you who&#xD;
ought to do that, Endy,"-she added gently.&#xD;
She put away the things, cleared the table, made up the&#xD;
fire, and smoothed the bed, ready for Johnny when he&#xD;
should want it; and then she came and sat down.&#xD;
"Won't you go ?" she said softly.&#xD;
"I would rather stay here."&#xD;
Faith folded her hands and sat waiting to be useful.&#xD;
Perhaps Mr. Linden thought it would be a comfort to&#xD;
her if he at least partly granted her request, perhaps ho&#xD;
thought it would be wise; for he said, laying his cheek&#xD;
against the child's,-&#xD;
"Johnny, if you will sit with Miss Faith now, I will lay&#xD;
&#xD;
my head down on one of your pillows for a little while, and&#xD;
you can call me the minute you want me."&#xD;
The child was very quiet and resting then? and leaning&#xD;
his head happily against Faith, watched Mr. Linden as he&#xD;
sat down by the bedside and gave himself a sort of rest in&#xD;
th~ way he had proposed; and then Faith's gentle voice&#xD;
was put in requisition. It was going over some things&#xD;
Johnny liked to hear, very softly so that no ears but his&#xD;
might be the wiser,-.-when the door opened and Jonathan&#xD;
Fax came in again. He~ glanced at Mr. Linden, and ad-&#xD;
vanced softly up to Faith. There stood and looked down&#xD;
at his child and her with a curious look.-.--that half recog-&#xD;
nized what it would not see.&#xD;
"You're as good to him as if he belonged to ye !.-.." said&#xD;
Jonathan, in a voice not clear.&#xD;
"So he does-" was Faith's answer, laying her cheek to&#xD;
the little boy's head. 'By how many ties,' she thought;&#xD;
but she added no more. The words had shaken her.&#xD;
"How's he getting' on ?" was the uneasy question next, as&#xD;
the father stooped with his hands on his knees to look&#xD;
nearer at the child.&#xD;
Did he not know? Faith for a minute held her breatl~.&#xD;
Then she lifted her face and looked up-looked full .into&#xD;
his eyes.&#xD;
"Don't you know, Mr. Fax, that Johnny cannot go any&#xD;
way but well?"&#xD;
The words were soft and low, but tl~e man stood up,&#xD;
straightening himself instantly as if he had received a blow.&#xD;
"Do you mean to say," he asked huskily, "that he is&#xD;
goin' to die?"&#xD;
It startled Faith fear 1~r. She did not know how much&#xD;
Johnny would understand or be moved by the words. And&#xD;
~ she saw that they had been heard and noted. With infinite&#xD;
~ softness and quietness she laid her cheek to the little boy's,&#xD;
answering in words as sweet as he had ever heard. from her&#xD;
Voice-as unfearful-&#xD;
"Johnny knows where he is going, if Jesus wants&#xD;
him "&#xD;
"Jesus is in heaven," the child said instantly, as if she&#xD;
had asked him a question, and with the same deliberate&#xD;
manner that he would have ansi her in Sunday school,&#xD;

&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
and raising his clear eyes to hers as he had been wont to&#xD;
do there. But the voice was fainter.&#xD;
Faith's head drooped lower, and her voice was fainter&#xD;
too-but clear and cheery.&#xD;
"Yes, darling-and we'll be with him there by and&#xD;
by."&#xD;
"Yes,'~ the child repeated, nestling his head against her&#xD;
in a weary sort of way, but with a little smile still. The&#xD;
father looked at Faith and at the child like one mazed and&#xD;
bewildered; stood still as if he had got a shock; then&#xD;
wheeling round spoke to nobody and went out. Faith&#xD;
pressed her lips and cheek lightly to Johnny's brow, in a&#xD;
rush of sorrow and joy; then began again some sweet Bible&#xD;
story for his tired little spirit.&#xD;
Mr. Linden did not long keep even his resting position,&#xD;
though perhaps longer than he would but for the murmur-&#xD;
ing talk which he did not want to interrupt. But when&#xD;
that ceased, he came back to his former seat, leaning his&#xD;
arm on Faith's chair in a silence that was very uninter-&#xD;
rupted. There were plenty of corners and goers in the&#xD;
outer room,-Miss Bezac, and Mrs. Stoutenburgh, and Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick, and Mrs. Somers, were all there with offers of&#xD;
assistance; but Mr. Linden knew well that little Johnny~&#xD;
had all he could have, and his orders to Reuben had been&#xD;
very strict that no one should come in. So except the&#xD;
various tones of different voices - which made their way&#xD;
once in a while-the two watchers had nothing to break the&#xD;
still quiet in which they sat. Their own words only made&#xD;
the quiet deeper, as they watched the little feet which they&#xD;
had first guided in the heavenward path, now passing on&#xD;
before them.&#xD;
"We were permitted to shew him i~he way at first,&#xD;
Faith~" Mr. Linden said, "but he is showing it to us now!&#xD;
But 'suffer them to come' ! - in death as in life."&#xD;
Much ot'the time the child slumbered-or lay in a half&#xD;
stupor, though often this was uneasy unless Mr. Linden&#xD;
walked with him up and down the roQm. Then he would&#xD;
revive a little, and look and speak quite brightly, asking for&#xD;
singing or reading or talk,-.-letting Faith smooth his hair,&#xD;
or bathe his face and hands, or give him a spoonful or two&#xD;
from one of her little cups; his face keeping its fair quiet&#xD;
&#xD;
RAV ANn anT, &#xD;
&#xD;
, ai&#xD;
&#xD;
look, even thoiiigh the mortal began to give way before the&#xD;
immortal.&#xD;
In one of these times of greater strength and refresh-&#xD;
inent, when he was in Mr. Linden's arms, he looked up at&#xD;
him and said,&#xD;
"Read about heaven-what you used to."&#xD;
Mr. Linden took his little Bible-remembering but too&#xD;
readily what that 'used' to be, and read softly and clearly&#xD;
the verses in Revelation-.&#xD;
"'And he showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem.&#xD;
.-And the city had no need of. the sun, neither of the moon,&#xD;
to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the&#xD;
* Lamb is the light thereof. And the nations of them that&#xD;
are saved shall walk in the light of it, and the kings of the&#xD;
earth do bring their glory and honour unto it. And the&#xD;
gates of it shall not be shut at all by day, for there shall&#xD;
be no night there. And there shall in no wise enter into&#xD;
it anything that defileth, or whatsoever worketh abomina-&#xD;
tion, or maketh a lie, but they that are written in the&#xD;
* Lamb's book of life."'&#xD;
The child listened, with his eyes upon his teacher's face&#xD;
and his arm round him, as he had been 'used,' too, and&#xD;
when the reading was finished lay quiet for a little time;&#xD;
while his friends too were silent - thinking of "the city&#xD;
that hath foundations."&#xD;
"That's the same gate," Johnny said in his slow, thought-&#xD;
ful way, as if his mind had o~one&#xD;
hymn.                            back to the morning&#xD;
"Yes," Mr. Linden said, with lips that would not quite&#xD;
be controlled, and yet answering the child's smile, "that is&#xD;
the gate where his little chtl shall go in! And that is the&#xD;
beautiful city where the Lord Jesus lives,, and where my&#xD;
Johnny is going to be with him forever-..-and where dear&#xD;
Miss Faith and I hope to come by and by."&#xD;
The child's hands were folded together, and with a fair,&#xD;
pure smile he looked from one face to the other; closing&#xD;
his eyes then in quiet sleep, but with the smile yet left.&#xD;
It was no time for words. The gates of the city seemed&#xD;
too near, where the little traveller's feet were so soon to&#xD;
enter. The veil between seemed so slight, that even sense&#xD;
might almost pass beyond it,-when the Heaven-light was&#xD;

&#xD;
already shining on that fair little face! Faith wiped away&#xD;
tears-and looked-and brushed them away again; but f~&#xD;
a long time was very silent. At last she said, very low,&#xD;
that it might be qu~etly~-.&#xD;
"Endecott-it seems tQ me as if I could almost hear&#xD;
them !"&#xD;
lie half looked the question which yet needed no answer,&#xD;
looking down then again at the little ransomed one in his&#xD;
arms, as he said in the same low voice, wherein mingled a&#xD;
note of the church triumphant through all its deep humau&#xD;
feeling,-&#xD;
"'And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy&#xD;
to take the book and to open the seals thereof, for thou&#xD;
wast slain: and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, out&#xD;
of every kindred, and tongue, and people and nation' 1"&#xD;
"And," said Faith presently, lower still,-.-" can't you, as&#xD;
Bunyan says, hear the bells of the city ringing for joy !-"&#xD;
Those 'choral harmonies of heaven,' heard or unheard,&#xD;
were stilling to mortal speech and even mortal feeling.&#xD;
~Yery quietly~ the minutes and the hours of that day suc-&#xD;
ceeded eachji other. Quietly even on the sick child's part;&#xD;
more so than yesterday; nature succumbed gently, and the&#xD;
restless uneasiness which had marked the night and the pre.&#xD;
ceding day gave place gradually before increasing fai ntn~ss&#xD;
of the bodily powers. There was little 'talk' called for&#xD;
after that time-hardly any, though never a word met his ~&#xD;
waking ear that did not meet the same grateful, pleased&#xD;
manner and smile. But the occasions became fewer&#xD;
Johnny slumbered gently, but more plainly a sleep that was&#xD;
nearing the end, in the arms of his best friend, who would&#xD;
let him even when unconsciou ave no worse resting-place&#xD;
..-would let every faint waking minute find the same earthly&#xD;
love about him that had been his dearest earthly refuge and&#xD;
stay. But earth was having less and less of her little immortal&#xD;
tenant; and as the hours of the afternoon began to te.lJ of&#xD;
failing light and a fading day, it was plain that the little&#xD;
spirit was almost ready to wing its way to the 'city that&#xD;
hath no necd of the sun."&#xD;
Mr. Fax came in sometimes to look at the child, but&#xD;
never staid long-never offered to take him out of the hands&#xD;
he perhaps unconsciously felt were mere of kin to him,&#xD;
&#xD;
spiritually, than his own. Out of the room, he sat down&#xD;
in the midst of his visitors and said nothing. lie seemed&#xD;
bewildered-.-or astounded. "I never knowed," he said&#xD;
once, "till that girl told me. I heard what the doctor&#xD;
said at night-hut I didn't think as he was any wiser than&#xD;
other doctors-and their word's about as good one side&#xD;
At the edge of the evening Reuben came' in to say that&#xD;
Mr. Skip was there with the sleigh.&#xD;
"Let him put Jerry in the stable and go home," Faith&#xD;
said softly to Mr. Linden. "One of Mr. Fax's men can&#xD;
harness him any time."&#xD;
"Dear Faith !" he said, "you had better go with him."&#xD;
"I can't go, Endecott. Don't tell me to go,"-she said&#xD;
with a determinate quietness.&#xD;
"How can I let you stay ?-you ought not to watch hero&#xD;
all night-.----unless there were something for you to do."&#xD;
"There may be something for me to do," she said, but n t&#xD;
as if that were what she wanted to stay for.&#xD;
"I think not," he said softly, and looking down again,&#xD;
"Faith-it is near the dawning !-.-and yet it may not e&#xD;
till the dawning. ud dear child, you ought not to wat h&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"It will not hur me," she said under her breath.&#xD;
"I know-" he aid with a gentle admission of all h r&#xD;
reasons and fall sympathy with all her wishes, ..-" but I&#xD;
think you ought not."&#xD;
"Do you mean," she said after a minute's pause,-..-.&#xD;
"that you wish me to go ?"&#xD;
It was hard for him to say yes-but he did.&#xD;
She sat still a moment, with her face in the shade; then&#xD;
rose up and arranged everything about the room which her,&#xD;
hands could better; made a cup of tea and brought it to&#xD;
Mr. Linden; and prepared herself for her ride. When&#xD;
she came at last, ready, with only her hood to put on, her&#xD;
face was almost as fair as Johnny's. There was no shadow&#xD;
on it of any kind, but clear day, as if a reflection from the&#xD;
'&amp;amp;ty' she had been rooking towards. She put her hand in&#xD;
Mr. Linden's and knelt down as she had done in the morn.&#xD;
ing to kiss Johnny. Her lips trembled-but the kisses were&#xD;

&#xD;
quietly given; and rising to her feet without speaking or&#xD;
looking, Faith went away.&#xD;
If .quietness was broken on the ride home, it was restored&#xD;
by the time she got there; and with the same clear look&#xD;
Faith went in. That Mrs. Derrick was much relieved to&#xD;
see her, was evident, but she seemed not very ready to ask&#xD;
questions. She looked at Faith, and then with a little&#xD;
sigh or two began softly to unfastenn her cloak and furs, and&#xD;
to put her jn a comfortable place by the fire, and to hasten&#xD;
tea, but all in a sort of sorrowful subdued silence; letting&#xD;
her take her own time to speak, or not speak at all, if she&#xD;
liked it better. Faith's words were cheerfully given, though&#xD;
about other things. And after tea she did in some measure&#xD;
justify Mr. Linden's decision in sending her home; for she&#xD;
laid herself on the couch in the sitting-room and ivent into&#xD;
a sleep as profound and calm as the slumbers she had left&#xD;
watching. ilet mother sat by her in absolute stillness-&#xD;
thinking of Faith as she had been in her childhood and&#xD;
from thence until now; thinking of the last time she her-&#xD;
self had been in that sick room, of th~ talk she had heard&#xD;
there-of the silence that was there miw: wiping away&#xD;
some tears now and then-.looking always at Faith with a&#xD;
sort of double feeling; that both claimed her as a child,&#xD;
and was ready to sit at her feet and learn. But as it came&#xD;
to the hour of bedtime, and Faith still slept, her mother&#xD;
stooped down and kissed her two or three times to wake&#xD;
her up.&#xD;
*" Pretty child," she said, "you'd better go to bed."&#xD;
Faith started with a recollective look and asked what&#xD;
time it was; then sank down again.&#xD;
"I'll wait an hour yet."&#xD;
"Had you better ?" her mother said gently. "I'll sit&#xD;
up, dear, and call you if you're wanted. iDid you think&#xD;
they'd send ?"&#xD;
"Send ?-O no, mother I"&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick was silent a minute. "Mr. Linden wouldn't&#xD;
come home to-night, dear."&#xD;
"Wouldn't he ?" said Faith startling; and for a minute&#xD;
tbe sorrowful look came back to her face. But then it re~&#xD;
turned to its high quiet; she kissed her mother and they&#xD;
went up stairs together.&#xD;

&#xD;
No, he did not come home,.-..-and well assnre~d that he&#xD;
would not, Faith ceased towatch for him, and fatigue and&#xD;
exhaustion again had their way. The night was very still&#xD;
-the endless train of stars sweeping on in their appointed&#xD;
course, until the morning star rose and the day broke.&#xD;
Even then Faith slept on. But when the more earthly&#xD;
light of the sun caine, with its bestirring beams, it roused&#xD;
her; and she started up, in that mood where amid quick&#xD;
coming recollections she was almost breathless for more&#xD;
tidings-waiting, as if by the least noise or stir she might&#xD;
lose something.&#xD;
It was then that she heard Mr.. Linden come in-even as&#xD;
~he sat so iistening,-heard him come in and come up stairs,&#xD;
with a slow quiet step that would have told her all, if the&#xD;
fact of his coming had not been enough. She heard his~&#xD;
door close, and then all was still again, except what faint&#xD;
sounds she might hear from the working part of the house&#xD;
below. Faith sat motionless till she could hear nothing&#xD;
more up stairs-and then kept her position breathlessly for&#xD;
a second or two longer, looking at the still sunbeams which&#xD;
came pouring into her room according to their wont, wi~h&#xD;
their unvarying heavenly message ;-and then gave way~&#xD;
rare for her-to a burst of gentle sorrow, that yet was not&#xD;
all sorrow, and which for that very mingling was the more&#xD;
heart-straitening while it lasted. The light of the fair&#xD;
clear Sunday morning bore su~h strange testimony of the&#xD;
'everlasting day' upon which her little charge of yesterday,&#xD;
had even entered! But the sense of that was quieting, if&#xD;
it was stirring.&#xD;
Not until the breakfast hour was fully come did Mr. Lin.-&#xD;
den make his appearance; but then he caine, looking pale&#xD;
indeed, and somewhat worn, yet with a face of rest. lie&#xD;
gave his hand to Mrs. Derrick, and coming up to Faith&#xD;
took her in his arms and kissed her, and gently put her in&#xD;
her chair at the table; waiving all questions till another&#xD;
time. There were none asked; Mrs. Derrick would not&#xD;
have ventured any; and the tinge in Faith's cheeks gav~&#xD;
token of only one of various feelings by which she was&#xD;
silenced. Yet that was not a sorrowful breakfast-..-for&#xD;
rest was on. every brow; on two of them it Was the very&#xD;

&#xD;
rest of the day when Christ broke the bars of death and&#xD;
rose.&#xD;
Breakfast had been a little late, and there was not much&#xD;
time to spare when it was over.&#xD;
"You had better not try to go out this morning, dear&#xD;
Faith," Mr. Linden said as they left the table and came&#xD;
round the fire in the sitting-room.&#xD;
"0 yes! I can go.-I must go "-she added softly.&#xD;
"I have not much to tell you,"-.he said in the same&#xD;
tone,-" nothing, but what is most sweet and fair. Would&#xD;
you like to go up there with me by and by ?"&#xD;
"Yes.-.After church ?"&#xD;
"After church in the afternoon would give us most&#xD;
time."&#xD;
The Sunday classes were first met.-.--how was not likely&#xD;
to be forgotten by scholars or teachers. It was an absorb-&#xD;
big hour to Faith and her two little children that were left&#xD;
to her; an hour that tried her very much. She controlled&#xD;
herself, but took her revenge all church time. As soon as&#xD;
she was where nobody need know what she did, Faith felt&#xD;
unnerved, and a luxury of tears that she could not restrain&#xD;
lasted till the service was over. It lasted no longer. And&#xD;
the only two persons that knew of the tears, were glad to&#xD;
have them come.&#xD;
After the afternoon service, when people were not only&#xD;
out of church but at home, Mr. Linden and Faith set out&#xD;
on their solitary drive-it was too far for her to walk,&#xD;
both for strength and time,-~--the afternoon was well on its&#xD;
way.&#xD;
The outer room into which Faith had tixst gone the day&#xD;
before, had a low murmur of voices and a little sprinkling&#xD;
of people within; but Mr. Linden let none of them stop&#xD;
her, and merely bowing as he passed through, he led her&#xD;
on. In the next room were two of the boys, but they went&#xD;
away at once; and Mr. Linden put his arm round Faith,&#xD;
lettirfg her lean all her weight on him if she chose, and led&#xD;
her up to the, bedside. They stood there and looked-as&#xD;
one might look at a ray of eternal sunlight falling athwart&#xD;
the dark shadows of time.&#xD;
The child*~ lay in his deep sleep as if NW. Linden had&#xD;
just laid him down; his head a little turned towards them,&#xD;
&#xD;
a little drooping, his hands in their own natural position&#xD;
~ on breast and neck. A faint pink-tinted wrapper lay in&#xD;
soft folds about him, with its white frills at neck and&#xD;
wrists,-on his breast a bunch of the first snowdrops&#xD;
spoke of the 'everlasting spring, and never - withering&#xD;
flowers!'&#xD;
With hearts and faces that grew every moment more&#xD;
quiet, more steady, Johnny's two teachers stood and looked&#xD;
at him ,-then knelt together, and prayed that in the way&#xD;
which they had showed him, they might themselves be&#xD;
found faithful.&#xD;
"You shouldn't say we "-said Faith when they had&#xD;
risen and were standing there again. "It was you-to&#xD;
him and me both." And bending forward to kiss the little&#xD;
face again, she added, "He taught me as much as he ever&#xD;
learned from, me !"&#xD;
But the words were spoken with difficulty, and Faith did&#xD;
not try any more.&#xD;
They stood there till the twilight began to fall, and then&#xD;
turned their faces homewards with a strange mingling of&#xD;
joy and sorrow in their hearts. How many times. Mr.&#xD;
Linden went there afterwards Faith did not know-she&#xD;
could only guess.&#xD;
There was no school for the next two days. Tuesday&#xD;
was white with snow,-not falling thick upon the ground,&#xD;
but in fine light flakes, and few people cared to be out.&#xD;
Mr. Linden had been, early in the morning,-since dinner&#xD;
~ he had been in his room; and now as it drew towards&#xD;
three o'clock, he came down and left the house, taking the&#xD;
~ road towards that of Jonathan Fax. Other dark figures&#xD;
now appeared from time to time, bending their steps in the&#xD;
same direction,-some sturdy farmer in his fearnought&#xD;
coat, or two of the school-boys with their arms round&#xD;
each other. Then this ceased, and the soft falling snow&#xD;
alone was in. the field.&#xD;
The afternoon wore on, and the sun was towards the&#xD;
setting, when a faint reddish tinge began to flush along the&#xD;
western horizon, and the snowflakes grew thinner. Theii,&#xD;
just as the first sunbeams shot through their cloudy prison,&#xD;
making the snow a mere white veil to their splendour, the&#xD;
little carriage of Mr. Somers came slowly down the road,&#xD;

and in it Mr. Somers himself. A half dozen of the neigh.&#xD;

Fax, borne by Reuben Taylor and Sam Stoutenburgh ~nd&#xD;
Phil Davids and Joe Deacon, each cap and left arm bound&#xD;
with crape; followed by Johnny's two little classmates-.&#xD;
Charles Twelfth and Robbie Waters. Then the chief&#xD;
mourners-Jonathan Fax and Mr. Linden, arm in arm,&#xD;
and Mr. Linden wearing the crape badge. After them the&#xD;
whole school, two and two. The flickering snowflakes&#xD;
fell softly on the little pall, but through them the sunbeams&#xD;
shot joyously, and said that the child had gone-&#xD;
"Through a dark stormy night&#xD;
To a calm land of light!'7-.--&#xD;
"Meet again? Yes, we shall meet again,&#xD;
Though now we part in pain!&#xD;
His people all.&#xD;
Together Christ shall call,&#xD;

"Child," said Mrs. Derrick in a choked voice, and&#xD;
wiping her eyes, when the last one had long passed out of&#xD;
view, "it's good to see him and Jonathan Fax walking to-&#xD;
gether!. anyway. I guess Jonathan 'Ii never say a word&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
&#xD;
i T seemed to Faith as if the little shadow which Febru-&#xD;
* ary had brought and left did not pass away-or rather,&#xD;
as if it had stretched on till it met another; though&#xD;
whence th~at came, from what possible cloud, she could&#xD;
not see. She was not the cloud-that she knew and felt:&#xD;
if such care and tenderness and attention as she had had&#xD;
all winter could be increased, then were they now,-every&#xD;
spare moment was given to her, all sorts of things were&#xD;
undertaken to give her pleasure, and that she was Mr.&#xD;
Linden's sunbeam was never more clear. Yet to her fancy&#xD;
that shadow went out and came in with him-..--lived even in&#xD;
her presence-nay, as if she had been a real sunbeam, grew&#xD;
deeper there. And yet not that,-..-what was it ? The&#xD;
slight change of voice or face in the very midst of some&#xD;
bright talk, the eyes that followed her about the room or&#xD;
studied her face while she studied her lesson-she felt if&#xD;
she did not see them,-even the increased unwillingness to&#xD;
have her out of his sight,-what did they all mean? So&#xD;
constant, yet so intangible,-so going hand in hand with&#xD;
all the clear, bright activity that had ever been part of&#xD;
Mr. Linden's doings; while the pleasure of nothing seemed&#xD;
to be checked, and yet a little pain mingled with all,-&#xD;
Fait~h felt puzzled and grieved by turns. She bore it for&#xD;
~a while~ in wondering and sorrowful silence, till she began&#xD;
to be afraid of the shadow's spreading to her own face.&#xD;
Kay, she felt it there sometimes. Faith couldn't stand it&#xD;
any longer.&#xD;
He had come in rather late one evening. It was a&#xD;
bleak evening in March, but the fire-never more wanted&#xD;
~-.burned splendidly and lit up the sitting-room in style.&#xD;
Before it, in the easy-chair, Mr. Linden sat meditating.&#xD;
lie might be tired-but Faith fancied she saw the shadow.&#xD;
She came up behind his chair, put both hands on one of&#xD;
his shoulders and leaned down.&#xD;

"Endecott "-she said in some of her most winning&#xD;
tones,-." may I ask you something ?"&#xD;
He came out of his muse instantly, and laying his hand&#xD;
on hers, asked her "what she thought about it herself?"&#xD;
"I think I may, if you'll promise not to answer me-..&#xD;
unless you have a mind !"&#xD;
"Do you suppose I would ?" Mr. Linden said laughing.&#xD;
"What trust you iiave in your own power !"&#xD;
"No, not a bit?" said Faith. "Then shall I ask you ?"&#xD;
"You are beginning to work upon my timid disposition!&#xD;
-of which I believe I once told you. What are you&#xD;
going to ask me ?-to challenge Dr. Harrison ?-or to run&#xD;
for President ?"&#xD;
"Would you like to do either of those two things ?"&#xD;
"I was only putting myself at your disposal-as I have&#xD;
done before."&#xD;
"Would you do either of 'em if I asked you ?" said&#xD;
Faith softly.&#xD;
"I suppose I am safe in saying yes !" said Mr. Linden&#xD;
smiling. "Little bird~why do you keep on the wing?"&#xD;
"I wanted to make sure of lighting in a right place,"&#xD;
said Faith. "Endy "-and her voice came back to the&#xD;
rich softness of the tones of her first question, a little&#xD;
dashed with timidity,-" has anybody been putting 'non-&#xD;
sense' into your head ?"&#xD;
He lifted her hand from its resting place, bringing it&#xD;
round to his cheek and lips at first in silence.&#xD;
"Do you know," he said, "that is just the point over&#xD;
which I thought you were hovering ?".-But the certainty&#xD;
had changed his tone. And rising up quick and suddenly,&#xD;
he drew her off to the sofa and seated her there, keeping&#xD;
his arm still about her as If for a shield.&#xD;
"Faith," he said, "do you remember that I promised&#xD;
some time to tell you a long story ?"&#xD;
She looked up into his face gravely and affectionately,&#xD;
reading his look. "But you won't have time for it now,&#xD;
Endecott.-.-tea will be ready directly. We must wait till&#xD;
by and by."&#xD;
"My little Sunbeam," he said, looking at her andi gently&#xD;
pushing back her hair, "do you know I love you very&#xD;

much ?-What made you think there was anything in my&#xD;
head but the most profound and abstract sense&#xD;
Faith shook her head with a little bit of a smile.&#xD;
"I saw that you were growing either more sensible of&#xD;
late-or less,-.-and I wanted to know which it was."&#xD;
"' Please to explain yourself! I-low could I grow more&#xD;
sensible ?-and in what way did I grow less ?"&#xD;
"I am talking nonsense?" said Faith simply. "But if it&#xD;
was sease in your head, Endy, there was a little too much&#xD;
of it; and II had seen nonsense look so-so I wanted to&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"Faith," Mr. Linden said, "you remind me often of that&#xD;
Englishman Madtt~e D'Arblay tells about,-who to the end&#xD;
of his life declared that his wife was the most beautiful&#xD;
sight in the world to him! Do you know I think he will&#xD;
have a successor&#xD;
H*~r colour rose bright, and for a minute she looked down&#xD;
at her diamonds. Then looked up demurely, and asked&#xD;
who Madame D'Arblay was?&#xD;
"She w~s an English woman, an authoress, a maid of'&#xD;
honour to the Queen. Do you wish to know anything&#xD;
about the other two persons I alluded to ?"&#xD;
One sparkling flash of Faith's soft eye, was all she gave&#xD;
him. "No, I don't think I do," she said.&#xD;
"You know enough already ?-.or too much? Faith-&#xD;
are Christmas roses to be in season all the year round ?"'&#xD;
"I don't know,-but tea is. Suppose I go and see about&#xD;
it-Monsieur?"&#xD;
"Eh bien-Mademoiselle," he said gravely but holding&#xD;
her fast,-" suppose you do !"&#xD;
"Then we should have it."&#xD;
"Undoubtedly, Mademoiselle! Vous avez reason."&#xD;
"And what have you ?" said Faith laughing.&#xD;
"I have you!...- Love and Reason did meet once, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"Did they ?" ~aid Faith looking up. "How should I&#xD;
know ?"&#xD;
"You never found it out in your own personal experia&#xD;
"You say it's a fact," said Faith. "I thought you&#xD;
referred to it as a former fact."&#xD;

"Like tea-" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Like tea, Endecott !-.-.what are you talking of ?"&#xD;
"Former facts."&#xD;
"I wonder what I shall get you to-night, Endecott"-.--she&#xD;
said merrily twisting round to look at him,-"you must&#xD;
want something! Is a thing properly said to be former, as&#xD;
long as it is still present ?"&#xD;
"What is present ?"&#xD;
"Tea isn't past"-said Faith with another little flash of&#xD;
her eye.&#xD;
"If you are going to set up for Reason," said Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den, "there is no more to be done; but as for me, I may&#xD;
as well submit to my fate. Shakspeare says, 'To love, and&#xD;
to be wise, exceeds man's might.'&#xD;
"I don't think I set up for reason," said Faith,-" only&#xD;
for tea; and you obliged me to take reason instead. I&#xD;
guiess-Shakspeare was right."&#xD;
"Unquestionably !" said Mr. Linden laughing. "Faith,&#xD;
did you ever hear of 'Love in a Cottage' ?"&#xD;
"I believe I have."&#xD;
"I hope you don't think that includes tea ?"&#xD;
"I never thought it included much good," said Faith.&#xD;
"I always thought it was something foolish."&#xD;
"There spoke Reason !" said Mr. Linden,-" and I shall&#xD;
not dare to speak again for ten minutes. Faith, you will&#xD;
have time to meditate." And his eyes ~vent to the fire and&#xD;
staid there. Faith meditated--or waited upon his media~&#xD;
tions; for her eyes now and then sought his face somewhat&#xD;
wistfully to see if she could read what he was thinking of&#xD;
.-which yet she could not read. But her exploring looks&#xD;
in that direction were too frequent to leave room for the&#xD;
supposition that Reason made much progress.&#xD;
"Faith," Mr. Linden s~tid, suddenly intercepting 'one of&#xD;
these looks, "now let us compare results-before we medi~&#xD;
tate any further. What have you to shew ?"&#xD;
"Nothing"-said Faith frankly.&#xD;
"I on my part have made a great discovery, which will&#xD;
perhaps answer for us both. It is very simple, as most&#xD;
great discoveries are, being merely this: that I prefer other&#xD;
things than reproofs from the lips of Reason. Will you&#xD;
have an illustration ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Can't I understand without ?" said Faith laughing, but&#xD;
with also a little rising colour~ And very smilingly she had&#xD;
her answer-the only answer she could expect.&#xD;
"I believe you are principled against saying yes !" said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "The most encouraging thing you ever said&#xD;
to me was 'Oh no !'&#xD;
What swift recollection, what quick sympathy with that&#xD;
time, spoke in the crimson of' Faith's.cheeks! It was some-&#xD;
thing to see 'the eloquent blood.' Eyes were not to be&#xD;
seen. Mr. Linden smiled, touching his hand softly to her&#xD;
cheeks.&#xD;
"0 Mignonette !" he said-" or I should rather say, 0&#xD;
Roses !--or 0 Carnation! Is there anything beyond that&#xD;
in your Flora ?"&#xD;
In the emergency Faith took possession of the hand that&#xD;
invaded her carnations and turning the full display upon&#xD;
him asked if he would not like to hav~ something more&#xD;
substantial. Apparently 'the display' was approved, though&#xD;
there were no words to that effect.&#xD;
"I suppose I must let you go," he said, "because if we&#xD;
are to study all the evening after tea, it will not do to talk&#xD;
away the whole evening before. You shall choose your owi~&#xD;
time for hearing my story, dear child-only let me know&#xD;
when the time comes."&#xD;
There was no shadow upon the tea hour, on Faith's part,&#xD;
nor on the hours of study 'that followed. The wind swept&#xD;
round the house, March fashion, but the fire and the~ open&#xD;
books laughed at him. There seemed even a little more&#xD;
'than usual of happy gayety in Faith's way of going through&#xD;
her work; she and the fire played at which should get&#xD;
ahead of the other; and between whiles she was obliged to&#xD;
use a little caution to obviate Mr. Linden's surprise at find-&#xD;
ing how far she was getting ahead of herself. For Faith's&#xD;
early morning studies were not now by any means contained&#xD;
to the lessons he set fur her and expected her to do; her&#xD;
object and endeavour was to prevent his requirements, and&#xD;
so prepare the ground before his teachings that without&#xD;
finding out how it came to be so ready, he should simply&#xD;
occupy more of it and cultivate higher. It was rather a nice&#xD;
matter! not to let him see that she had done too much, and&#xD;

yet to make him know that he might take what harvests he&#xD;
pleased off the ground; with such keen eyes too, that knew&#xD;
so well all the relative forces of soil and cultivation and&#xD;
could estimate so surely the fruits of both. Faith managed&#xD;
by not managing at all and by keeping very quiet, as far as&#xD;
possible showing him nothing he did not directly or mdi.&#xD;
reedy call for; but sometimes she felt she was grazing the&#xD;
edge of discovery, which the least lifting of the veil of&#xD;
Mr. Linden's unsuspiciousness would secure. She felt it&#xD;
to-night, and the fire and she had one or two odd little con.&#xD;
sultations. Just what Mr. Linden was consulting with&#xD;
himself about at those times, she did not know; but she&#xD;
half fancied it was something. Once the fire called her off&#xD;
at the end of a lesson, and when she came back to the table&#xD;
he had the next book open; but it was not till this ~et of&#xD;
questions and answers and explanations was half through,&#xD;
that Faith discovered he had opened the book at a different&#xD;
place from the one where it had been closed the day before,&#xD;
.-then it suddenly flashed upon her; but whether it had&#xD;
been by accident, or of intent, she did not know.&#xD;
One last consultation Faith held with the fire while Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick was gathering her work together to go to bed,&#xD;
Then she brought a low seat to Mr. Linden's feet. "1~ow,&#xD;
Endy,- I am ready." A. little smile -a soft, lingering&#xD;
touch upon her forehead, came with his words.&#xD;
"My little Mignonette, what do you suppose I came to&#xD;
Pattaquasset for ?"&#xD;
She looked rather wondering at him, and then said, "I&#xD;
supposed-..-to teach the school."&#xD;
"Yes, but to what end ?-I mean in my intent. I know&#xD;
now what I came for, in one sense," he said, securing one&#xD;
of her hands.&#xD;
"Why-Endeco~t, do you want me to tell you ?"&#xD;
"If you know or guess.~~&#xD;
"I don't know nor guess anything. I supposed merely&#xD;
that you did that as other people do other things-and for&#xD;
the same reason."&#xD;
"It was for a very commonplace reason," Mr. Linden&#xD;
said, watching her face with two or three things at work in&#xD;
his own: "it was to get money to finish my studies for&#xD;
your favourite profession."&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
133&#xD;
&#xD;
"My favourite profession !-.Which do you mean ?"&#xD;
"Have you forgotten Miss Essie's question? I have&#xD;
not-nor the dear child who was so unwilling to answer it."&#xD;
Faith's mind went back to Miss Essie, the question and&#xD;
answer,.-and took the round of the subject,.-and even as&#xD;
she did so her face changed, a sort of grave light coming&#xD;
into it.&#xD;
t~Do you mean that, Endy ?" she said half under her&#xD;
breath.&#xD;
"I mean that, and no other."&#xD;
The light brightened and deepened-her colour flushed&#xD;
like a morning sky,-till at last the first sunbeam struck&#xD;
athwart her face, in the shape of a smile. It was not a lip&#xD;
smile-.-it was on eye and brow and lip and cheek together.&#xD;
Mr. Linden bent down by her, lifting her face to meet his&#xD;
eyes, which through all their intentness smiled too.&#xD;
"Faith, I want to hear every word of that."&#xD;
"Of what ?"&#xD;
"Of all that is in your mind and face just now."&#xD;
Her two little answering sentences evidently only gave&#xD;
the key of very deep tones.&#xD;
"I think it is good, Endy. I am glad."&#xD;
"I thought you would be. But that does not satisfy&#xD;
me, dear Faith-I want you to say to me all the different&#xD;
things that your thoughts were saying to you. You are&#xD;
not afraid of me at this time of day ?" he said bringing her&#xD;
face closer.&#xD;
"I have nothing to say I need be afraid to say," Faith&#xD;
answered slowly,-" but it is hard to disentangle so many&#xD;
thoughts. I was thinking it is such great and high work-~&#xD;
such happy work-and such honour-and then that you&#xD;
will do it right, Endecott-" she hesitated.-" how could&#xD;
I help but be glad ?"&#xD;
"Do you like your new pi~ ospective position, little Sun-&#xD;
beam ?"&#xD;
A deep colour came ovei' her face, and the eyes fell,&#xD;
Yet Faith folded her hands and spoke.&#xD;
"I was glad to think-" She got so far, but the sen-&#xD;
tence was never finished.&#xD;
"Glad to think what, dear child ?"&#xD;
Faith glanced up. She did not want to. answer. Then&#xD;

&#xD;
she said with the greatest simplicity, "I am glad if I may&#xD;
do something."&#xD;
"Glad that I should realize my ideal ?" Mr. Linden said&#xD;
with a smile, and softly bringing her face round again.&#xD;
"Faith, do you know what a dear little 'minister's wife'&#xD;
you will make ?.-Mignonette is so suitable for a parson..&#xD;
age !.-so well calculated to impress the people with a&#xD;
notion of the extreme grave propriety which reigns there!&#xD;
For is not Mignonette always sweet, demure, and never.-..&#xD;
by any chance 1-high coloured ?"&#xD;
She would not let her face be held up. It went down&#xD;
upon her lap-into her hands, which she pressed close to&#xD;
hide it.&#xD;
"Oh Endecott 1-." she said desperately.-" You'll have&#xD;
to call me something else."&#xD;
"0 Faith 1" was his smiling reply,-"I will, just so soon&#xD;
as I can. Don't you want to come over to the sofa and&#xD;
hear the rest of my story ?"&#xD;
"Your story! Oh yes!"&#xD;
And first having a sympathizing interview with the&#xD;
fire, Faith went over to the sofa and sat down; but hid her&#xD;
face no more. Much as he had done before tea, Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den came and sat dowii by her,-with the same sort of&#xD;
gentle steadiness of manner, as if some strong thread of&#xD;
feeling had wrapped itself round an equally deep thread&#xD;
of purpose,-his gay talk now as then finding always some&#xD;
contrast in his face. But of this Faith had seen little or&#xD;
nothing-her eyes had not been very free to look. She&#xD;
did notice how silently he stood by her as she put the fire&#xD;
in order, she did notice the look that rested on her as she&#xD;
took her seat, but then he began his story and she could&#xD;
thing of nothing else.&#xD;
"It was given to me, dear Faith," he said, "to spend&#xD;
my boyhood in an atmosphere more like the gloxv of that&#xD;
firelight than anything I can compare it to, for its warmth&#xD;
and radiance; where very luxurious worldly circumstances&#xD;
were crowned with the full luxury of earthly love. But it&#xD;
was a love so heaven-directed, so heaven-blessed, that it&#xD;
was but the means of preparing me to go out into the cold&#xD;
alone. That was where I learned to love your diamonds,"&#xD;
he added, taking the jewelled hand in his,-" when I used&#xD;
&#xD;
to see them not more busy among things of literature and&#xD;
taste, than in all possible ministrations to the roughest and&#xD;
poorest and humblest of those whom literature describes&#xD;
and taste shrinks from !-But I used to think," he said&#xD;
speaking very low, "that the ring was never so bright, nor&#xD;
sb quick moving, as when it was at work for me."&#xD;
Faith's eye fell with his to the diamonds. She was very&#xD;
still; the flash all gone.&#xD;
"That time of my life," Mr. Linden presently went on,&#xD;
"was passed partly in Europe and partly here. We came&#xD;
home just after I had graduated from a German University,&#xD;
but before I went away again-.----ahnost everything I had in&#xD;
the world went from me." He was silent for a little, draw-&#xD;
ing Faith's head down upon his shoulder and resting his&#xD;
lightly upon it, till she felt what she was to him. Then he&#xD;
looked up and spoke quietly as before.&#xD;
"Pet and I were left alone. A sister of my father's was&#xD;
very anxious to take her, but Pet would not hear of it, and&#xD;
so for a year we lived together, and when I went to the&#xD;
Seminary she went too,-living where I lived, and seeiu~&#xD;
what she could of me between times. It was not v~ery&#xD;
good for her, but it was the best we could do then. I sup-&#xD;
pose there was some mismanagement on the part of my&#xD;
father's executors-or some complication in his affairs, I&#xD;
need not trouble you with details; but we were left with-&#xD;
out much more than enough to give her the income II wished&#xD;
her to have for her own private use. Of course I would&#xD;
not touch that for our joint expenses. But until a year&#xD;
ago we did still~ live together-by various means. Then&#xD;
this sister of my father's set her heart upon taking Pet&#xD;
with her to Europe-and I set mine almost as much; 1 could&#xD;
better bear to live alone, than to have her; and her life&#xD;
then amounted to tha~ And so between us both she con.-&#xD;
sented-very unwillingly; and she went to Italy, and I&#xD;
studied as long as I had ways and means, and then came&#xD;
here to get more. So you see, dear child," Mr. Linden&#xD;
said with a smile, "it is not my fortune I have asked you&#xD;
to share, but yiy fortunes."&#xD;
She gave him a smile, as bright and free as the glancing&#xD;
of a star; then her look went away again. And it was a&#xD;
good little while before perhaps she dared speak-perhaps&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
before she wanted to speak. So very steady and still her&#xD;
look and herself were, it said that they covered thoughts&#xD;
too tender or too ~ep to be put into words. And the&#xD;
thoughtfulness rather deepened as minutes rolled on-and&#xD;
a good many of them rolled on, and still Faith did not&#xD;
speak. Mr. Linden's watch ticked its remarks unhindered.&#xD;
Words came at last.&#xD;
"Endecott-.you said something about 'means' for study.&#xD;
flow much means does it want ?-.and how much study~'&#xD;
The interest at work in the question was deeper than Faith&#xD;
meant to shew, or knew she showed.&#xD;
He told her the various expenses, ordinary and contingent,&#xD;
in few words, and was silent a moment. But then drawing&#xD;
her close to him, with that same sort of sheltering gesture&#xD;
she had noticed before, he went on to answer her other&#xD;
question; the voice and manner giving her a perfect key&#xD;
to all the grave looks she had mused over.&#xD;
"Do you remember, dear Faith, that I once called you&#xD;
'a brave little child' ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"You must be that now," he said gently,-" you and I&#xD;
must; both be brave, and cheerful, and full of trust. Be.&#xD;
cause, precious child, I have two years~ work before me-&#xD;
and the work cannot be done here."&#xD;
She looked in his face once, and was silent ;-what her&#xD;
silence covered could only he guessed. But it lasted a, little&#xD;
while.&#xD;
"It must be done at that place where you were xvith&#xD;
your sister ?"&#xD;
"Yes, little Mignonette, it must be done there."&#xD;
"And when must you begin the work, Endecott ?" If the&#xD;
words cost her some effort, it only just appeared.&#xD;
"I came for a year, dear Faith-and I ought not to&#xD;
stay much beyond that."&#xD;
Faith mentally counted the months, in haste, with a&#xD;
pang; but the silence did not last long this time. Her&#xD;
head left its resting place and bending forward she looked&#xD;
up into Mr. Linden's face, with a sunny clear look that met&#xD;
his full. It was not a look that could by ?rny means be&#xD;
mistaken to indicate a want of other feeling, however.&#xD;
One might as soon judge from the sunshine gilding on&#xD;
&#xD;
the slope of a mountain that the mountain is made of&#xD;
tinsel.&#xD;
"Endecott..-is that what has been the matter with&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
She needed no answer but his look, though that was as&#xD;
Wear as her own.&#xD;
"I could easier bear it if I could bear the whole," he&#xD;
said. "But you can understand that Dr. Harrison's pro-&#xD;
posal tried, thoug~vit did not tempt me."&#xD;
She scarce gave a thought to that.&#xD;
"There is one thing more I wanted to ask. Will there&#xD;
be-" she paused, and went on,-" no time at all that you&#xD;
can be here ?"&#xD;
"Dear Faith !" he said kissing her, "do you think I&#xD;
could bear that? How often I shall be able to come I&#xD;
cannot quite tell, but come I shall-.-from time to time, if&#xD;
I live. And in the meanwhile we must make letters do&#xD;
a great deal."&#xD;
Her face brightened. She sat quietly looking at him.&#xD;
"Will that shadowcome any more,-now that you have&#xD;
told me&#xD;
"I will give you leave to scold me, if you see it," Mr.&#xD;
Linden said, answering her smile,-" I ought not to be iii&#xD;
K shadow for a minute-with such a sunbeam in my posses-&#xD;
sion. Although, although !-do you know, little bright&#xD;
one, that the connexion between sunbeams and shadows is&#xD;
very intimate? and very hard to get rid of?"&#xD;
"Shall I talk to you about 'nonsense' again ?"-sho&#xD;
~aid half lightly, resting her hand on his arm arid looking&#xD;
at him. Yet behind her light tone there was a great ten-&#xD;
derness.&#xD;
"You may-and I will plead guilty. But in which of&#xD;
the old classes of 'uncanny' folk will you, put me ?-with&#xD;
those who were known by their having no shadow, or with&#xD;
those who went always with two ?"&#xD;
"So I suppose one must have a little shadow, to keep&#xD;
from being uncanny !"&#xD;
"You and I will not go upon that understanding, dear&#xD;
Faith."&#xD;
I~'aith did not look like one who had felt no shadow;&#xD;
rather perhaps she looked like one who had borne a blow;&#xD;

&#xD;
a look that in the midst of the talk more than once&#xD;
brought to Mr. Linden's mind a shadowy remembrance&#xD;
of her as she was after they got home that terrible evening;&#xD;
but her face had a gentle brightness now that then was&#xD;
wanting.&#xD;
"I don't know "-she said wistfully in answer to his last&#xD;
words. -" Perhaps it is good. I dare say it is, for me. It&#xD;
is a shame for me to remind you of anything-but don't&#xD;
you know, Endecott.-' all things are ours' p-both 'thin o~s&#xD;
present and things to come ?"' And he~ eye looked up&#xD;
with a child's gravity, and a child's smile.&#xD;
Bear it alone ?.-ycs, he could have done that-as he had&#xD;
borne other things,-it tried him to see her bear it. It&#xD;
touched him to see that look come back-to see any tern.&#xD;
peering of the bright face she had worn so long. Faith&#xD;
hardly knew perhaps with what eyes he had watched her&#xD;
through all the conversation, eyes none the less anxious for&#xD;
the smile that met hers so readily; she hardly guessed what&#xD;
pain her bright efforts at keeping up, gave him. To shel-&#xD;
ter and gladden her life was the dearest delight of his;&#xD;
and just now duty thwarted him in both points. And he&#xD;
knew-almost better than she did-how much she de-&#xD;
pended on him. He looked down at her for a moment&#xD;
with a face of such grave submission as Faith had never&#xD;
seen him wear.&#xD;
"My dear little child !" he said. But that sentence was&#xD;
let stand by itself. The next was spoken differently. "II&#xD;
do know it, dear Faith,-and yet you do well to remind&#xD;
me. I need to be kept up to the mark. And it is not&#xD;
more true that each day has sufficient evil, than that each&#xD;
has sufficient good-if it be only sought out. There can~&#xD;
not much darkness live in the light of those words."&#xD;
"Ho i~r far have you to go," she said with demure arch-&#xD;
ness,-" to find the good of these days ?"&#xD;
"You are quick at conclusions "-said Mr. Linden,-&#xD;
"how far do you think it is between us at present ?"&#xD;
"Endecott "-she said gravely-"it will never be fur-&#xD;
ther 1"&#xD;
He laughed a little-with a half moved half amused&#xD;
expression, wrapping her up like some dainty piece of&#xD;
preciousness. "Bccause every day that I am away will&#xD;

hring us nearer together? I suppose that is good mea-&#xD;

"You know," she said, "you have told me two things&#xD;
to-night, Endecott; and if one makes me sorry, the other&#xD;
makes me glad."&#xD;
"Ii was sure of that !-.-And it is such great, great&#xD;
pleasure to think of the times of coming back-and&#xD;
of leaving you work to do, and of writing to you about it,&#xD;
..-and then of finding out how well it is done! You must&#xD;
keep my books for me, Mignonette-mine, I say !-.---they&#xD;
are as much yours as mine-and more."&#xD;
"Your books ?"..--she said with a flush.&#xD;
"Yes-there are but a few of these that I shall want&#xD;
with me,-the most of my study books I did not bring&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"But won't you want these with you ?"&#xD;
"As far from that as possible. Do you think you could&#xD;
m~ke up your mind to let me tell Reuben a secret ?.-.~-and&#xD;
give him a reason for being even more devoted to you than&#xD;
he is now?"&#xD;
She coloured very brightly again. "I am willing-if&#xD;
you wish it. Why, Endecott ?"&#xD;
"The chief reason is, that I do not wish to lose any of&#xD;
your letters, nor have you lose any of mine. And small&#xD;
postofilces are not so safe as large ones, nor are their&#xD;
managers proverbially silent. I should like to make Reu-&#xD;
ben a sort of intermediate office."&#xD;
"And send your letters to him ?"&#xD;
"Yes. Would you mind that ?"&#xD;
"And my letters ?"&#xD;
"And yours in like manner, little Mignonette. He could&#xD;
either enclose them to me, or put them in some neighbour-&#xD;
ing office,- I think Reuben would enjoy an eight miles&#xD;
walk a day, taken for me. Or you could hide your en-&#xD;
velope with another, and let him direct that. You need&#xD;
not be afraid of Reuben,"-Mr. Linden said smiling,.......&#xD;
"you might give him forty letters without his once daring&#xD;
to look at you.~7&#xD;
"But I thought-you said-he was going to college&#xD;
next summer ?"&#xD;
"That was talked o1 but I think he will stay another&#xD;

year at home, and then enter a 1~igher class. It will save&#xD;
expense, and he will be longer with his father. Reuben&#xD;
and I hope to be brother ministers, one day, Faith."&#xD;
"Do you! Does he !"-said Faith astonished. "That&#xD;
is good! I am glad of it. But what will he do for money,&#xD;
Endecott ?"&#xD;
"We shall see-part of~ the way is clear, so we may&#xD;
hope the rest will be. Perhaps I may let him do some&#xD;
of his studying with me. Do you think you would object&#xD;
to that?"&#xD;
"Object to it! How could I? Wl~at do you mean,&#xD;
Endecott ?"&#xD;
"0 little Mignonette !" he said smiling, "how sweet you&#xD;
are !-.and what joy it would be to see you wear the only&#xD;
title I can give you! Don't you know, pretty child, that&#xD;
if I gave Reuben ITebrew you might be called upon to&#xD;
give him-tea!"&#xD;
Faith's eyes went down and her colour mounted, and&#xD;
mounted. But her next remark was extremely collected,&#xD;
"How good it was Dr. Harrison's money came&#xD;
"I believe you stipulated that we were to have tea&#xD;
ourselves," said Mr. Linden? "but the question remains&#xD;
whether you would dispense it to any one else."&#xD;
Faith was only restrained from covering her face again&#xD;
by, the feeling that it would be foolish; and withal a little&#xD;
laughter could not be prevented. She did shield' one side&#xD;
of her face with her hand, and leaning upon it looked into&#xD;
the fire for suggestions. Finally answered sedately, "I&#xD;
should think you and he might have it together !"&#xD;
"Have it-..-yes, if we could get it; but I am ignorant&#xD;
of any but the chemical properties of milk and sugar."&#xD;
"I thought you said you knew cream when you saw it!"&#xD;
said Faith from behind her shield.&#xD;
"That is knowing its appearance-not its properties,&#xD;
Miss Reason."&#xD;
~" What does reason want to know more, for a cup of&#xD;
tea?"&#xD;
"But you have declared once to-night that I am not&#xD;
Reason," said Mr. Linden laughing. "For instance-I&#xD;
once made the sudden acquaintance of a particular person,&#xD;
who made as sudden an irnp~'ession on my mind,~after&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
141&#xD;
&#xD;
those three minutes I should have known her by sight (like&#xD;
cream) to the end of my life. But I went on trying ex-&#xD;
periments-(as one might taste successive drops of cream)&#xD;
finding out more and more sweetness each time; until&#xD;
(like cream again) I discovered that she was perfectly&#xD;
inUispensable to my cup of tea !"&#xD;
Faith bowed her' glad little head, laughing, though&#xD;
feeling much deeper was at work.&#xD;
"After this," she said, "I shall always be greatly at a&#xD;
loss what you are thinking of when you are looking&#xD;
at me."&#xD;
"XVill your reflections be carried on with such a face ?"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden. "Do you remember that afternoon,&#xD;
Faith ?.-when I so nearly laid hold of you-.and you&#xD;
wanted to laugh, and did not dare ?'~&#xD;
"What afternoon ?"-&#xD;
"The one wherein I first had the pleasure of seeing you.&#xD;
How demurely you eyed me !-and wondered in your little&#xD;
sensible heart what sort of a person I could possibly be !"&#xD;
"How did you know I wondered ?" said Faith colour~&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
"By your very gentle, modest, and fearful examinations,&#xD;
your evident musings over my words, and the bright look&#xD;
now and then that told of progress."&#xD;
Faith laughed.&#xD;
"You made me begin to think and wish immediately,"~&#xD;
she said.-." It was no wonder I wondered."&#xD;
"Yes, and how I longed to give you your wish, so far as&#xD;
T could,.-.and how afraid I was to offer my services,-and&#xD;
how you would persist in thanking me for pleasing myself,&#xD;
do you remember, little Sunbeam ?-and your fright when&#xD;
I asked about Prescott ?"&#xD;
She looked up with the prettiest, rosiest remembrance&#xD;
of it all; and then her face suddenly changed, and turning&#xD;
from him she shielded it again with her hand, but not to&#xD;
hide the rosy colour this~time. Mr. Linden drew her close&#xD;
to him, resting hi~ face upon her other cheek at first&#xD;
without words.&#xD;
"Dear child !" he said,.-"my own little Mignonette !-.&#xD;

not forget that I hope to c~ome home quite often. There&#xD;

was a time, when I thought I might have to go away and&#xD;
never have the right to come and see yott again. And you&#xD;
must think to yourself~~though you will not speak of it to&#xD;
me-that after this bit of time, all our life will be spent&#xD;
together. You need not expect me to wait for anything-.&#xD;
not even the cottage you like so much."&#xD;
She did not answer immediately, as was natural, his last&#xD;
suggestion5 not being very word-provoking with her. But&#xD;
when she did speak, it was in a clear, cheerful tone.&#xD;
"I'll bear my part, Endy-J should be very ungrateful&#xD;
if I couldn't. And you can bear your part-I am glad to&#xD;
think of that t-for you are working for a Master that&#xD;
always gives full pay."&#xD;
"We can always bear God's will," he said, a little&#xD;
gravely,.-"it is only our own that points the trial and&#xD;
makes it unbearable."&#xD;
&#xD;
OIIAPTER X.&#xD;
~AI Til had no chance to think that night. She went&#xD;
[to sleep conscientiously. And a chance the next&#xD;
morning was out of the question. She dared not come&#xD;
down as early as usual, if her own strength would have let&#xD;
her. The few minutes before breakfast were busy ones;&#xD;
and the few hours after breakfast. Faith went about with&#xD;
the consciousness of something on her heart to be looked&#xD;
at; but it had to bide its time. Her household duties done,&#xD;
her preparations for Mr. Linden being already in advance,&#xD;
she had leisure to attend to this other thing. And alone&#xD;
Faith sat down and looked at it.&#xD;
It was the first rea.l steady trial her life had known. ITer&#xD;
father's death had come when she was too young to feel&#xD;
deeply any want that her mother could not fill. To be&#xD;
away from anything she much loved was a sorrow Faith&#xD;
hardly knew by experience. But a two years' separation was&#xD;
a very, very heavy and sharp pain to think of; and Faith&#xD;
had an inward assurance that the reality would be heavier&#xD;
and sharper than her thoughts beforehand could make it.&#xD;
Perhaps it was too great a pain to be struggled with; for&#xD;
Faith did not struggle-..--or not long. She sat down and&#xD;
looked at it,-what she had no'~ dared to do the night&#xD;
before ;~-.-mea~urcd it and weighed it; and then bowed her&#xD;
heart and head to it in utter submission. With it came such&#xD;
a crowd of glad and good things, things indeed that made&#xD;
the trial and were bound up with it,.-..-that Faith locked the&#xD;
one and the other up in her heart together. And remem-&#xD;
bering too the sunshine of joy in which she had lately lived,&#xD;
she humbly confessed that some check might be needed to&#xD;
remind her and make her know that earth has not the best&#xD;
sunshine, and that any gain would be loss that turned her&#xD;
eyes away from that best, or lessened her sense of its'&#xD;
brightness.&#xD;

&#xD;
So there came no shadow over her at all, either that day&#xD;
or afterwards. The clear light of her face was not clouded,&#xD;
and her voice rung to the same tune. There was no&#xD;
shadow, nor shade of a shadow. There was a little sub.&#xD;
dued air; a little additional gravity, a trifle more of ten.&#xD;
derness in her looks and ways, which told of the simpleness&#xD;
of heart with which she had quietly taken what God gave&#xD;
and was content with it.&#xD;
To Mr. Linden the trial was not new, and to sorrow of&#xD;
various kinds he was wanted; but it was new to him to see&#xD;
her tried, and to that he found it hard to accustom himself.&#xD;
Yet he carried out his words,-Faith could feel a sort of&#xD;
atmosphere of bright strength about her all the time. I-low&#xD;
tenderly she was watched and watched over she could&#xD;
partly see, but pain or anxiety Mr. Linden kept to himself.&#xD;
He set himself to work to make her enjoy every minute.&#xD;
Yet he never shunned the subject of his going away,-he&#xD;
let her become used to the sound of the words, and to every&#xD;
little particular connected with it-they were all told her&#xD;
by degrees; but told with such bright words of hope and&#xD;
trust, that Faith took the pain as it were diluted.&#xD;
Before all this had gone far-indeed not many days after&#xD;
the first telling of his story, Faith had come down as usual&#xD;
one early morning to her work. She had been down about&#xD;
an hour, when she heard the door open and Mr. Linden&#xD;
came in. He had two seconds' view ot the picture before&#xD;
she rose up to meet him. There was no lamp yet burning&#xD;
in the room. A fire of good hard wood threw its light&#xD;
over everything, reflected back from the red curtains&#xD;
which fell over the windows. In th~ very centre of&#xD;
the glow, Faith sat on a low~ cushion, with her book on a&#xD;
chair. She was dressed exactly, for nicety, as if she might&#xD;
l~ave been going to Judge Harrison's to tea. And on the&#xD;
open pages, and on Faith's bright hair, edging her ruffles,&#xD;
and warming up her brown @ess, was the soft red fall of&#xD;
the firelight. She rose up immediately with her usual glad&#xD;
look, behind which lay a doubtful surmising as to his errand.&#xD;
It was on her lips to ask what had 'brought him down so&#xD;
early, but she was prudently silent. He came forward&#xD;
quick and quietly, according to his wont, 'not at all as if she&#xD;
were about anything unusual, and giving her one of those&#xD;
&#xD;
greetings wliichdid sometimes betray the grave feeling he&#xD;
'~ kept so well in hand, he br6ugh t her back to the fire.&#xD;
at:: Little bird," he said, "what straws are you weaving in&#xD;
present ?"&#xD;
I don't know. Kot any-unless thoughts."&#xD;
"Will it please you to state what you are doing ?"&#xD;
"I was reading. I had just got to the end of the story&#xD;
of Moses blessing Israel. I was thinking of these words-"&#xD;
and she took up her book and showed him. "Happy art&#xD;
thou, 0 Israel, saved of the Lord, the shield of thy help,&#xD;
and who is the sword of thy excellence."&#xD;
"Did you ever look out any of the answering passages&#xD;
in other parts of the Bible ?"&#xD;
"Not often. I don't know them. Once in a while I&#xD;
think of one. And then they are so beautiful !"&#xD;
Mr. Linden took the book from her hand, turning from&#xD;
place to place and reading to her.&#xD;
"'J~appy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help,&#xD;
and hope is in the Lord his God: which made heaven,&#xD;
earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth&#xD;
~, truth forever.' That is what David said, -then hear how&#xD;
~ Isaiah answers-' Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust,&#xD;
j and not be afraid: for the LORD JEIIOYAII is my&#xD;
strength and my song; he also is become my salvation.'-&#xD;
And again-' Israel shall be saved in the Lord with an&#xD;
everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor con-&#xD;
founded, world without end."7&#xD;
Faith drew a little quick breath.&#xD;
"Doesn't it seem," she said, "as if words were heaped on&#xD;
words to prevent our being afraid ?"&#xD;
"I think it really is so; till we have a shield of promises&#xD;
as well as protection. After Abraham had gone out of his&#xD;
own country, 'not knowing whither he went,' 'the word of&#xD;
the Lord came to him, saying, Fear not, Abraham, I am&#xD;
thy shield and thy exceeding great reward.' Then David&#xD;
takes that up and expatiates upon it,-finding in 'it 'both&#xD;
things present and things to Come', dear Faith."&#xD;
"'For the Lord God is a sun and a shield: the Lord will&#xD;
give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from&#xD;
them that walk uprightly. 0 Lord of hosts, blessed is the   P&#xD;
man that trusteth ii~ thee.'"&#xD;

She looked down at the words, then up at him with ~&#xD;
glad, sunshiny light in her eyes. Her comment on the&#xD;
whole was heartfelt% and comprehensive. "How good ji~&#xD;
was you came down this morning I"&#xD;
"Would you like to have me come every morning ?"&#xD;
"Oh how much !-But that's no use, Endecott."&#xD;
"Why not ?"&#xD;
"I mustn't get to depending upon you too much," she&#xD;
said with a smile.&#xD;
"What had you been musing about-to make you so glad&#xD;
this morning?" he said looking at her.&#xD;
"Nothing !-but those passages as you read them one&#xD;
after the other were so beautiful, and felt so strong.-.It was&#xD;
a great pleasure to hear you read them,"-she said dropping&#xD;
her voice a little in 'confession.&#xD;
"It shall be as you like, darling, about my coming again.&#xD;
But dear Faith, of this other morning work you must let&#xD;
me say a word."&#xD;
"What, Endecott ?"&#xD;
"You are doing too much."&#xD;
"No. What makes you think so ?"&#xD;
Significantly Mr. Linden laid his hand on the pile of&#xD;
study books.&#xD;
"Well ?"&#xD;
"Well.-For the future please to let these gentry rest in&#xD;
peaceful seclusion ubtil after breakfast."&#xD;
"Oh no, Endy ~"&#xD;
"My dear, I s~all have you turning into a moonbeam.&#xD;
Just imagine wh4 it would cost me to call you 'pale Cyn-&#xD;
thia' 1"&#xD;
"You needn't imagine it, Endecott."&#xD;
"Only so far as to prevent the reality. Do you know I&#xD;
have been afraid of this for some time."&#xD;
"Of what?"&#xD;
"Afraid that you were disregarding the bounds I have&#xD;
laid down for study and the sun for sleep."&#xD;
"I didn't know you had laid down any ~ she said&#xD;
gaily again,-" and I never did mind the sun."&#xD;
"Well won't you mind me ?" said he smiling. "I have a&#xD;
right to expect that in study matters, you know."&#xD;
"Don't try mel-" said Faith, very winningly, much nioto&#xD;
&#xD;
than she knew. He stood looking at hei', with the sweet&#xD;
unbent expression which was her special right.&#xD;
"Faith, don't you mean to love to have me take care of'&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
That brought a change of look, and it was curious to see&#xD;
the ineffectual forces gather to veil what p' spite of them&#xD;
wreathed in her smile and laid an additional roseleaf upon&#xD;
each cheek. The shy eyes retreated from view; then they&#xD;
were raised again as she touched his arm and said,. with a&#xD;
demure softness, "What must I do, Endy ?"&#xD;
"Be content with the old study horns, my dear child.&#xD;
They are long enough, and many enough."&#xD;
"Oh Endy !-not for me."&#xD;
"For thee."&#xD;
Faith looked down and looked disturbed.&#xD;
"Then, Endecott, I sha'n't be as wise as I want to be,.-.&#xD;
nor as you want to have me."&#xD;
"Then you will he just as wise as I want you to be," he&#xD;
said with a smile. "As to the rest, pretty child,-do you&#xD;
mean that my wife shall deprive me of my scholar ?"&#xD;
Faith turned away and said rather quickly, "Endy, how&#xD;
did you know ?"&#xD;
"From some lesson evidence. And I always hear you.&#xD;
come down-and whiles I see a face at breakfast which has&#xD;
not lately come from rest."&#xD;
Faith's secret thought was that it was better than rest.&#xD;
But after folding her hands with a grave face, she looked&#xD;
up at Mr. Linden with a smile which yielded the whole&#xD;
question.&#xD;
"To prove to you what a naughty child you have been,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden, "I shall give you an increase of outdoor&#xD;
lessons, and take. you off on an expedition the first mild&#xD;
day. On which occasion you may study me-if you have&#xD;
any of Miss Essie's curiosity."&#xD;
"Don't 21?" said Faith. "And I am going to do it more.&#xD;
What expedition are you going on, Endecott ?"&#xD;
"Up to Kildeer river I have business there. Will&#xD;
you trust yourself to me in a boat-~---if I will let you steer ?"&#xD;
"I'll do anything to go," said Faith. "And I suppose&#xD;
if I steered wrong, the helm would come about pretty&#xD;
quick !" And so ended her last early morning studies.&#xD;

&#xD;
It was in the afternoon of the same day that Faith put&#xD;
in practice what she bad been thinking of when she avowed&#xD;
her determination of further studying Mr. Linden. He had&#xD;
come home from school, and it was the dusky hour again;&#xD;
the pleasant interrognum between day and night when even&#xD;
busy folk take a little time to think and rest. Mr. Linden&#xD;
was indulging in both apparently; he was in one of those&#xD;
quiet times of doing nothing' which Faith chose for making&#xD;
~ny of her very gentle attacks upon him. Gue seemed to&#xD;
be in meditation now. She stole up behind him and leaned&#xD;
down on the buck of his chair, after her wont.&#xD;
"Endecott"-she said softly.&#xD;
Faith's voice was in ordinary a pleasant thing to hear;&#xD;
but this name from her lips was always a concretion of&#xD;
sweetness, flavoured differently as the case might be.&#xD;
Sometimes with mere gladness, sometimes with the spirit&#xD;
of fun, often enough with a little timidity, and sometimes&#xD;
with a rose-drop from the very bottom of her heart's well;&#xD;
with various compounds of the same. But this time it was&#xD;
more than timidity; Faith's one word was spoken as from&#xD;
lips that were positively afraid to follow it with others.&#xD;
"That note," said Mr. Linden smiling, "seems to come&#xD;
from the top of a primeval pine tree - with a hawk in&#xD;
sight! Little bird, will you please come down into the lower&#xD;
regions of air ?-where you can be (comparatively) safe."&#xD;
Faith laughed; but the hawk remained in sight-of her&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"You said this morning I never asked you any but&#xD;
impossible things."&#xD;
"Most sorrowfully true !.-.-.have you another one ready ?"&#xD;
"If. I ask you something possible, what will you do ?"&#xD;
she said, softly touching the side of his head with her hand.&#xD;
It was Faith's utmost freedom; a sort of gentle admiring&#xD;
touch of her fingers which the thick locks of hair felt&#xD;
hardly more than a spider's feet.&#xD;
"That Liepends so much upon the thing !" he said, half&#xD;
turning to give her the look which belonged to his words.&#xD;
"There are such a variety of ways in which I might deal&#xD;
with it--and with you."&#xD;
"I am not going to ask you anything but what would be&#xD;
right.&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
149&#xD;
&#xD;
"You do not doubt that my answer will be conformable ?"&#xD;
"Yes I do. It will be your 'right,' but it may not be&#xD;
my 'right,' you know."&#xD;
"If you get what is not your right, you ought to be&#xD;
upntented," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Now you have turned me and my meaning round;&#xD;
Endecott-yOLl know Aunt Dilly gave me something ?....&#xD;
mayn't I-won't you let me lend it to you ?"&#xD;
Very low and doubtfully the words came out! But if&#xD;
Faith had any more to say, she had little chance for&#xD;
a while. One quick look round at her Mr. Linden gave,&#xD;
but then he sprang up and came to where she stood, lifting&#xD;
her face and giving her her "right" in one sense at least.&#xD;
Other answer he made none.&#xD;
"Endy-have I asked a possible thing this time ?" she&#xD;
said under breath.&#xD;
"My precious child !-Do you think it possible ?"&#xD;
"It ought to be possible, Endecott." And if ever an&#xD;
humble suggestion of a possibility was made, Faith made&#xD;
it then.&#xD;
"I shall have to go back to my first answer," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden,-"~ have no words for any other. ~Faith, dearest&#xD;
-don't you know that it is not needful? Will that con~&#xD;
tent you, little sweet one&#xD;
A soft "no."&#xD;
"Why not ?" he said, making good his threat. "What&#xD;
do you want me to have more than I need ?"&#xD;
"I fear the ways you will take to make that true. I&#xD;
should think you might, Endecott !"-The ellipsis was not&#xD;
hard to supply.&#xD;
"I shall not take any unlawful means-nor any unwise&#xD;
ones, I hope," lie said lightly. "What are you afraid I&#xD;
shall do ?"&#xD;
"Get up early in the morning," she whispered.&#xD;
"But that is so pleasant! Do you suppose I get up&#xD;
late now, little bird ?"&#xD;
"Not late, with breakfast at seven. How early do you ?"&#xD;
"Philosophically early! Do you know you have not&#xD;
had your poem to-day ?~..-..what shall it be? sunrise or&#xD;
sunset ~"&#xD;
"Which you please," she said gently, with the tone of a&#xD;

mind upon something else. Mr. Linden looked down at&#xD;
her in silence for a minute.&#xD;
"Dear Faith," lie said, "31 told you truly that there is no&#xD;
need. This year's work has done quite as much as J&#xD;
thought it would. What are you afraid of?"&#xD;
"I am not afraid of much," she said, looking up at hira&#xD;
now with a clear brow. "But Endy, I have changed my&#xD;
mind about something. Could you easily come down and&#xD;
read with me a little while every morning ?.-or are you&#xD;
busy ?"&#xD;
"I am never too busy to spend time with you, my child,&#xD;
.-.-that is one piece of pleasure I shall always allow myself.'&#xD;
At what hour shall I come&#xD;
"At six o'clock, can you ?" said Faith. "If you gave&#xD;
me a quarter of an hour then, I should still have time&#xD;
enough for breakfast work. This morning I was afraid-.&#xD;
but I was foolish. This evening I want all I can get. :And&#xD;
~-~wi~n you read me a ladder of verses again," she said&#xD;
sm1liDg~ "I shall mark them in my Bible, and then' 11 shall&#xD;
have them ~by and by-when you are gone."&#xD;
"Yes, andAKcan send you more. lit is good to go up a&#xD;
ladder of Bible\erses when one is afraid-or foolish," he&#xD;
said gently and answering her smile. "One end of it&#xD;
always rests on earth, within reach of the weakest and&#xD;
weariest."&#xD;
"That is just 'it! Oh Endy,".-she said, clasping her&#xD;
hands sadly and wishfully before her and her eyes filLing as&#xD;
she spoke.-"i wish there were more people to tell people&#xD;
the truth !"&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
was a fair, fair May morning when Mr. Linden and&#xD;
Faith set forth on their expedition to Kildeer river.&#xD;
After their early rising and early breakfast, they took their&#xD;
way down to the shore of the M~ng, where the little sail-&#xD;
boat lay rocking on the incoming tide, her ropes and&#xD;
streamers just answering to the mol~ning breeze. 'i'he soft&#xD;
spring sunlight glinted on every tree and hillside. The&#xD;
"Balm of a Thousand Flowers "-true and not spurious-.&#xD;
was sprinkled through the air, under the influence of&#xD;
which unseen nectar the birds became almost intoxicated&#xD;
with joy; pouring out their songs with a sort of spend-&#xD;
thrift recklessness,--the very fish caught the infection, and&#xD;
flashed and sparkled in the blue water by schools at a&#xD;
time.&#xD;
In the sailboat now stood 'baskets and shawls, a book or&#xD;
two, an empty basket for wild flowers, and by the tiller sat&#xD;
Faith-invested with her new dignity but not yet instructed&#xD;
therein. Mr. Linden stood on the shore, with the boat's&#xD;
detaining rope in his hand, looking about him as ~f he had&#xD;
a mind to take the good of things as he went along. Up&#xD;
the hill from the shore, trotted Jerry and Mr. Skip.&#xD;
"Endecott," said Faith joyously,-" goethe would have&#xD;
more than enough if he was here."&#xD;
She was not a bad part of the picture herself; fair and&#xD;
glad as she looked, as fair as the May morning and the&#xD;
birds and the sunlight.--&#xD;
"Isn't this air sweet ?"&#xD;
£~XTery V But Goethe would choose my point of view.&#xD;
So much depends, in a picture, upon th~ principal light !"&#xD;
I wonder which is the~ principal light to-day !" said&#xD;
Faith laughing. "116w it sparkles all over the river,-~~&#xD;
atid then on the ~oun g leaves and buds ;--and then soft&#xD;
shining on the clouds. And they are all May! Look at&#xD;

those tiny specks of white cloud scattered along the horizon,&#xD;
up there towards Neauticut."&#xD;
"The principal~ light to-day," said Mr. Linden, "is one&#xD;
particular sunbeam, which as it were leads off the rest.&#xD;
It's a fair train, altogether !" and~ he threw the rope into&#xD;
the little vessel, and jumped in himself; then lifting Faith&#xD;
a little from her place, and arranging and disposing of her&#xD;
daintily among shawls and cushions, and putting her un~&#xD;
wonted~flngers upon the tiller.&#xD;
"Now Miss Derrick," he said, "before we g~ any further,&#xD;
I should like to know your estimate and understanding of&#xD;
the power at present in your hands."&#xD;
"I know what a rudder is good for," said Faith merrily.&#xD;
"I know that this ship,~ 'though it be so great, and driven&#xD;
of fierce winds, yet is it turned about with a very small&#xD;
helm whithersoever the governor listeth.' That is what&#xD;
you may call theoretical knowledge."&#xD;
"Clearly your estimate covers the ground! But you&#xD;
perceive, that while you take upon yourself the guiding of&#xD;
the boat-(if I might venture to suggest !-.--our course lies&#xD;
up the Mong, and not out to sea)-1, with my sail, control&#xD;
the motive power."&#xD;
"You mean that if I don't go right, you'll drop the&#xD;
sail ?"-.&#xD;
"Not at all !-I shall navigate, not drift. Do you sup-&#xD;
pose I shall surrender at the firs's summons&#xD;
"What would you consider a 'summons' ?" said Faith&#xD;
with a funny look. "I don't think your sail can ~lo much&#xD;
against my rudder."&#xD;
"My sail regulates the boat's headway-which in its&#xD;
turn affects the rudder. (If we run down those fishermen&#xD;
the damages may be heavy.) But you see I have this ad-&#xD;
vantage,.-I know beforehand your system of navigation-&#xD;
you don't know mine. Let me inform your unpractised&#xD;
eyes, Miss Derrick, that the dark objects just ahead of us&#xD;
is a snag."&#xD;
"My eyes don't see any better for that information,"&#xD;
said Faith; with great attention however managing to&#xD;
guide their lhtle craft clear of both snag and fishermen,&#xD;
and almost too engaged in the double duty to have leisure&#xD;
for laughing. But practice is the road to excellence and&#xD;
&#xD;
ease; Faith learned presently the correspondence between&#xD;
the rudder and her hand, and in the course of a quartet'&#xD;
of an hour could keep the north track with tolerable&#xD;
steadiness. The wind was fair for a straight run up the&#xD;
Mong. The river stretching north in a diminishing blue&#xD;
current (pretty broad however at Pattaquasset and for&#xD;
some miles up) showed its low banks in the tenderest&#xD;
grading of colour; very softly brown in the distance, and&#xD;
near the eye Opening into the delicate hues of the young&#xD;
leaf. The river rolled its bright blue, and the overarching&#xD;
sky was like one of summer's. Yet the air was no~ so,~&#xD;
spicy from young buds; and the light was Springy; not&#xD;
Summer's ardour nor Summer's glare, b~zt that loveliest&#xD;
promise of what is coming and oblivion of what is past.&#xD;
So the little boat sailed up the Mong. Mr. Linden's sail&#xD;
was steady, Faith's rudder was still.&#xD;
"Faith," Mr. Linden said suddenly, "have you made up&#xD;
your mind to my letter plan ?."&#xD;
"About Reuben ?-O yes. I am willing."&#xD;
"You know you are to send me every possible question&#xD;
that comes up in the course of your studies, and every&#xD;
French exercise, and every doubt or discomfort of any&#xD;
kind-if any should come. I shall not- be easy unless IL&#xD;
think that."&#xD;
"But you won't have time ftr my French exercises 1"&#xD;
"Try me. And~you are to take plenty of fresh air, and&#xD;
not a bit of fatigue; and in general are to suppose your-&#xD;
self a rare little plant belonging to me, which I have left&#xD;
in your charge for the time being. Do you understand,&#xD;
Mignonette ?"&#xD;
Tier blush and smile, of touched pleasure, showed abund-&#xD;
ance of understanding.&#xD;
"But I want you to tell me, Endecott, all the things in&#xD;
particular you would like to have me do or attend to while&#xD;
you are away~besides my studies. I have been thinking&#xD;
to ask you, and waiting foragood time."&#xD;
"'All the things' ?-of what sort, dear child ?"&#xD;
"Aren't there some of your poor people you would like&#xD;
to have particularly attended to? I could get Reuben to&#xD;
go with me, you know, where it was too far for me to go&#xD;
alone,~or moth er.'&#xD;

"Yes, there are some things you might do," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden, "for me and for them, though more in the way of&#xD;
sending than going; the places are too far off. But I&#xD;
should like to know that Mrs. Ling's mother had a bunch&#xD;
of garden flowers now and then, and that another went to&#xD;
that little lame girl on the Monongatesak road; and once&#xD;
in a great while (not often, or they will lose their charm)&#xD;
you may send the Roscoms two fresh eggs 1--not more, ou&#xD;
any account. Reuben will go for you, anywhere-and the&#xD;
Roscoms are old proteges of~his."&#xD;
"I didn't mean to forget the IRoscoms," said Faith.&#xD;
"But must one manage with them so carefully ?"&#xD;
"In matter of favors, yes. And even in matter of&#xD;
visits, to a certain degree,-their life is so monotonous&#xD;
that novelty has a great charm. Reuben used to go and&#xD;
read to them almost every day on his way from school, but&#xD;
I found it best to make my coming an event."&#xD;
"Can I do anything for Reuben ?"&#xD;
"Nothing new that I know of, at present-you are&#xD;
doing something for him all the while,-and it will be a&#xD;
wonderful delight to him to bring you letters. Then if&#xD;
you are ever driving down that Monongatesak road, with&#xD;
nothing to hinder, take the little lame child with yot~ for&#xD;
a mile or two,-she so pines to be out of the house and&#xD;
moving. Would it be disagreeable to you? there is&#xD;
nothing but what is pleasant in her appearance."&#xD;
"What if there were ?" she said with a wistful look at&#xD;
him. "Do you mind disagreeablenesses? and do you want&#xD;
to have me mind them ?"&#xD;
"No, dear child, but you must get wanted by degrees,-&#xD;
and some temperaments can never bear what others can.&#xD;
What if we were to overhaul those fishermen ?"&#xD;
"What do you want ?" said Faith, as she carefully set&#xD;
the boat's head that way..-"A fish for dinner ?"&#xD;
"No "-said Mr. Linden,-" I have too much respect&#xD;
for that basket at my feet. But you know, Faith,. we are&#xD;
having a SQrt of preliminary play-practice at seeking our&#xD;
fortune; to-day,-we must carry it out. Just imagine, my&#xD;
dear, that we are adrift in this boat, with nothing at all&#xD;
for dinner, and supper a wild idea 1-not the eastern fisher-&#xD;

dred pieces of gold, would then appear so interesting as&#xD;
these."&#xD;
"If you wanted dinner from them-but r you say you&#xD;
don't," said Faith laughing. "Endecott, I don't under-&#xD;
stand in the least! And besides, you said you wouldn't&#xD;
'~drift' but navigate 1"-&#xD;
And her soft notes rolled over the water, too soft to reach&#xD;
the yet somewhat distant fishermen.&#xD;
"And so because I turn navigator you turn $iren 1" said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. " But i have you ~safe in my boat-I need&#xD;
not stop to listen."&#xD;
"But what did you mean&#xD;
"iBy what?"&#xD;
"All that."&#xD;
sa~1&#xD;
"Short and comprehensive 1" Mr. Linden-"come&#xD;
up on the other side, Faith, the current is less strong. All&#xD;
about seeking our fortune, do you mean? Did you never&#xD;
hear of any other extraordinary prince and princess who&#xD;
did the same&#xD;
"If I am not adrift in the boat, I am in my wits !" said&#xD;
Faith,-" and with no sail nor rudder either. Why are&#xD;
those fishermen interesting, Endecott ?"&#xD;
"Why my child," he said, "in the supposititious case&#xD;
which I put, they were interesting as having fish, while we&#xD;
had no~e. But in the reality.-..---they were picturesque in the&#xD;
distancd,-what they are near by we will see," he added&#xD;
with a smile at her, as the sail came round and the little&#xD;
boat shot up alongside of her rough-looking relation.&#xD;
"Well friends, what cheer ?-besid~s a May morning and a&#xD;
fair wind ?"&#xD;
The fishermen slowly dragging their net, hoarsely specu-&#xD;
lating on its probable weight of fish, paused both their&#xD;
oars and tongues and looked at him. One of the men had&#xD;
the oars; the other at the end of the boat was hauling in,&#xD;
hand over hand.&#xD;
"That's about all the cheer you want, I guess,-..-.aint it ?'~&#xD;

"Somewhat of a variety," Mr. Linden said with a smile.&#xD;
"What makes the fish come into your net ?"&#xD;
"Haven't an idee !" said the maii-" without it bees that&#xD;
fish is very onintelligent creturs. I don't suppose fish&#xD;
has much brains, sir. And so they goes further and fares&#xD;
worse." Which statement of the case he appeared to think&#xD;
amusing.&#xD;
"But then why do they sometimes stay out ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden,......." because I have read of nien who 'toiled all the&#xD;
night and caught nothing.&#xD;
"Wall, you see," said the fisher, ~' they goes in shoals or&#xD;
flocks like, and they's notional. Some of 'em won't come&#xD;
at one time o' tide, and some won't come at another-and&#xD;
they has their favourite places too. Then if a man sets his&#xD;
nets where the fish aint, all creation might work and catch&#xD;
nothing . This side the river is better now than over&#xD;
there."&#xD;
"These men that I was talking of~" said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
once found a difference even between the two sides of&#xD;
their ship. But the other time, when they had caught&#xD;
nothing all the night, in the morning they caught so&#xD;
many that their net broke and both their ~hip~ began to&#xD;
&#xD;
"What kind o' folks was them ?" said the oarsman a little&#xD;
scornfully.&#xD;
"Why they were fishermen," said Mr. Linden. "They&#xD;
followed your calling first, and then they followed mine."&#xD;
"What's yourn ?" said the other, in his tone of good-&#xD;
liumoured interest. "Guess you're a speaker o' some sort-.&#xD;
aint ye I"&#xD;
"Yes-" Mr. Linden said, with a little demure gesture&#xD;
of the head,-." I am-' of some sort,' as you say. But I've&#xD;
got an account of these men in my pocket-don't you want;&#xD;
to hear' it ?.-.it's more interesting than any account you&#xD;
could have of me."&#xD;
"Like to hear it well enough-" said die man at the net,~&#xD;
setting himself astride the gunwale to listen, with the net&#xD;
hanging from his hand.&#xD;
"I wouldn't mind knowing how they worked it-" said&#xD;
the other man, while Mr. Linden threw a rope round one&#xD;
of the thole-pin.s of the fishing boat and gave the other end&#xD;
to Faith, and then took out his book. And Faith was&#xD;
'amused at the men's submissive attention, and the next&#xD;
minute did not wonder at all !-as ~he noted the charm that&#xD;
held them-the grace of mingled ease, kindliness, and power,&#xD;
in Mr. Linden's manner and presence. Nothing could&#xD;
have greater simplicity, and it was not new to Faith, yet&#xD;
she looked at him as if she had never seen him before.&#xD;
"A great many years ago," he said, "when the Son of&#xD;
God, our Lord Jesus Christ, was in this world, he went&#xD;
about healing sick people, and teaching every one the way&#xD;
to heaven; and the people came in great numbers to hear&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"'And it came to pass, that, as the people pressed upon&#xD;
him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake ~f&#xD;
Gennesareth, and saw two ships standing by the lake; but&#xD;
the fishermen were gone out of them, and* were washing&#xD;
"We wash our'n by pulling' em through the water," said&#xD;
the net man.&#xD;
"The Lord entered one of the ships, which belonged to&#xD;
~ man named Simon, and asked him to push out a little&#xD;
from the shore. 'And he sat down, and taught the people&#xD;
out of the ship. Now, ghen he had left speaking, he said&#xD;
VOL. IL                14&#xD;

unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and jet down your&#xD;
nets for a draught. And Simon answering, said unto him,&#xD;
Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken&#xD;
nothing; nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the&#xD;
net."'&#xD;
"In course! whether 'twas any use or not,"-the man&#xD;
with the net said approvingly. "So he had oughter."&#xD;
"Yes, and he knew it would be of use in some way, for&#xD;
God never gives a command without a reason. And when&#xD;
they had let down the net, 'they enclosed a great multitude&#xD;
of fishes: and their net brake. And they beckoned unto&#xD;
their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should&#xD;
come and help them. And they came, and filled both the&#xD;
ships, so that they began to sink."'&#xD;
"That was a bigger. haul than ever I see, yet," remarked&#xD;
the man.&#xD;
"Neither had Simon ever seen anything like it-he&#xD;
knew that it was brought about by the direct power of God,&#xD;
"'When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus'&#xD;
knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, 0&#xD;
Lord. For he was astonished, and all they that were&#xD;
with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had&#xD;
taken."'&#xD;
"Can't see what he said that fur," said the oarsman.&#xD;
"No more don't I 1" said the other. "He had got a good&#xD;
haul o' fish, anyway-if he was ever so 1-and we aint none&#xD;
of us white lilies."&#xD;
"But then Peter knew that he ought to be a white lily-&#xD;
and such a new view of God's power and greatness made him&#xD;
feel it more than ever. So that he was both afraid and&#xD;
ashamed,-.he thought himself unworthy to have the Lord&#xD;
in his ship, and was afraid to have him stay there."&#xD;
"I wouldn't have asked him to go out, if he had been in&#xD;
inine,.-I don't think ! ?'.-.said the elder fisher slowly. "I&#xD;
don't see as that chap need to ha' been afeard.-.he hadn't&#xD;
done nothing' but good to him."&#xD;
"But it's what we do ourselves that makes us afraid,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden. "So. it was with Adam and Eve in the&#xD;
garden, you know-God ~had talked to them a great many&#xD;
times, and they were never afraid till they disobeyed him~&#xD;
then the moment he spoke they ran and hid themselves."&#xD;
&#xD;
The oarsman was silent, the other man gave a sort of&#xD;
grunt that betokened interest.&#xD;
"What shines had this feller been cutting' up 7"&#xD;
"Why !" said Mr. Linden, starting up and taking his&#xD;
stand by the mast, as the little boat curtseyed softly over&#xD;
the waves, "if you tell one of your boys always to walk dl&#xD;
one particular road, and you find him always walking in&#xD;
another-I don't Utink it matters much what he's doing&#xD;
~ there, to him or to you."&#xD;
"Wall ?"-said the man, with a face of curiosity for&#xD;
what was to come next, mingled with a cei~tain degree of&#xD;
intelligence that would not confess itself.&#xD;
I "Well-Peter knew he was not in th~ i4ay wherein the&#xD;
Lord commands us all to walk."&#xD;
"I guess every feller's got to pick out his own road for&#xD;
himself !" said the fisher, pulling up a foot or two of his net&#xD;
carelessly.&#xD;
"That'swhat Peter had thought,-and so he had lived,&#xD;
he chose. But when he saw more of the glory of&#xD;
God, then he was afraid and confessed his sin. And what&#xD;
d suppose the Lord said to him then ?7'&#xD;
"What did Peter own up to ?"&#xD;
"The accQunt gives only the general confession~.-that he&#xD;
was a sinful man, not worthy to have the Lord look upon&#xD;
him except in anger. You see he falls down at his feet and&#xD;
prays him to depart-he could not believe that the Lord&#xD;
would stay there to speak good to him."&#xD;
"Well-what did he say to him ?"&#xD;
"'He said unto him, Fear not'. And no one need fear,&#xD;
who humbly confesses his sins at the feet of Jesus, 'for if&#xD;
we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our&#xD;
sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.' Then the&#xD;
Lord bade Simon and all his companions to follow him-.&#xD;
and they obeyed. And now I want to tell you what this&#xD;
following means."&#xD;
lie put one arm round the mast, half leaning against it,&#xD;
and gave them what Faith would have called a 'ladder'&#xD;
passing from the 'Follow me,' spoken to Peter,- to&#xD;
the young man who being bid to follow, 'went away sora&#xD;
L~O~hil',.......to the descriijtion of the way given in the tenth&#xD;

chapter of John, - to the place whither the flock follow&#xD;
Christ-&#xD;
"'And I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on the mount&#xD;
Zion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand,&#xD;
having his Father's name written in their foreheads'.&#xD;
'These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he&#xD;
goeth.'"&#xD;
rrhe men listened, open-mouthed and with intent eyes ;~&#xD;
partly to the speaker, it was evident, and partly to what&#xD;
the speaker said. And that his words took hold, it was&#xD;
also evident. When he ceased, the man at the net dropped&#xD;
his cycs for a moment, a curious look of meditation cover.&#xD;
ing his face.&#xD;
"It's easy to talk of follerin'," he said with a half laugh&#xD;
which was not of carelessness,-" and one might like to,-.&#xD;
but it's plagney hard to know where to start !-"&#xD;
"It's easy for God to teach you-and easy to ask him to&#xD;
do it. If it was anything else you wanted to do, you&#xD;
would not stop trying till you found out," said Mr. Linden&#xD;
-" and that is just the way here. Now I am going to give&#xD;
you a copy of all this," he said, throwing his own little Bihie&#xD;
softly into Faith's lap and stepping forward to the prow&#xD;
of the boat (which she thought held only lunch baskets)-.&#xD;
"and I shall turn down a leaf at the story of the net full&#xD;
of good fishes-and another at a place that tells of a net&#xD;
full 'of every kind, both bad and good.' And I want you&#xD;
to read them, and think about them, and find out how to&#xD;
follow Christ- and then come on !" He took his seat&#xD;
once more in the stern of the boat, and held out the&#xD;
Bible to the fisherman. The other man, slowly dip.&#xD;
ping his oars in and out, met his look too, but made no&#xD;
answer.&#xD;
The man at the net took the book and turned over the&#xD;
leaves with a wondering, considering air.&#xD;
"What do you reckon this here's worth ?" he said some-&#xD;
what awkwardly, without raising his eyes from it.&#xD;
"Worth daily reading and study-worth all you have in&#xD;
the world, if you will use it right," said Mr~ Linden. "You&#xD;
need not think ~tbout any other value-.-L had it in trust to&#xD;
give away."&#xD;

"I'm much obleeged to you,-.-- I'll taire a look at it now&#xD;
~ and then. Do you live along here, anywlieres ?"&#xD;
"In Pattaquasset, just now," Mr. Linden said, as he&#xD;
prepared to make sail again. "I don't very often come to&#xD;
this part of the river."&#xD;
"Well hold on !" said the man, beginning to pull in his&#xD;
net with great vivacity,-" I'm bound to give you a fish-&#xD;
if I've got one here. Bear a hand, Dick! Haint you got&#xD;
a place on hoard there that you can stow it, without skeerin'&#xD;
the lady ?"-...&#xD;
"I'll try to find one !" said Mr. Linden, answering the&#xD;
proposal just as it was meant. "If the lady is scared she&#xD;
shall turn her face the other way."&#xD;
"She'll turn it which way you say ?-" ventured the&#xD;
fisher insinuatingly.&#xD;
Faith did not seem afraid of the fish, by the way she&#xD;
leaned over the stern of the boat and eyed the up-coming&#xD;
nets which the men were drawing in. She had listened to.&#xD;
the foregoing talk, to the full as intently as those for whom&#xD;
it was meant, and with a multitude of interests at work in&#xD;
her mind and heart of which they had never dreamed.&#xD;
And now her eye was bent on the net; but her thoughts&#xD;
were on that other kind of fishing of which she had just&#xD;
seen an example-the first she had ever seen of Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den's !-.and her full heart was longingly thinking, among&#xD;
other thoughts, of the few there were to draw those nets, and&#xD;
the multitude to be drawn! What Faith saw in the ni~shes&#xD;
the man's hands were slowly pulling up !-.&#xD;
But the fisherman only saw-what pleased him greatly,&#xD;
some very fine fish; shad they were for the greater part ~&#xD;
from which he selected a noble specimen and cast it over&#xD;
into Mr. Linden's boat. Then standing up in his own he&#xD;
wiped his hands on the sleeves of his coat.&#xD;
"Hope you'll come along again some day," said he.&#xD;
"And" (waggishly) "don't come without the lady 1"-.&#xD;
The rope was drawn in and the little skiff shot ahead&#xD;
smoothly and silently from the great brown fishing boat and&#xD;
her equally brown owners. Gliding on -watched for a&#xD;
little by the fishers, then their attention was claimed by the&#xD;
flapping shad in the net, and the sail boat set her canvas&#xD;
towards Kildeer river. Mr. Linden went forward and&#xD;

bestowed his prisoner a little more out of sight and sound&#xD;
in some place of safety, and then sitting down in the l)1'ow&#xD;
dipped his hands in the blue water and took a survey of&#xD;
Faith, as she sat in the s'~ern-the tiller in her hand, the&#xD;
shadow of the sail falling partly across; the spring zephyr~&#xD;
playing all about her.&#xD;
"Little bird," he said, "why don't you sing ?"&#xD;
A smile of much and deep meaning went back from the&#xD;
stern to the prow; but she presently made the somewhat&#xD;
obvious remark that "birds do not al~vays sing."&#xD;
"A melancholy fact in natural history ! the truth of which&#xD;
I am just now experiencing. What shall be done with&#xD;
them at these times-are they to be coaxed-or chidden-..&#xD;
or fed with sponge cake? Have you got any in your&#xD;
basket ?"&#xD;
"Are you hungry ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"Only for words-or songs-or some other commodity&#xD;
of like origin," Mr. Linden said, coming back to his old&#xD;
place. "What shall I have ? if I cannot get the two&#xD;
first ?"&#xD;
"You might haveY~ittle patience ?-"&#xD;
"'Patience', my dear, 'is a good root'-but nothing akin&#xD;
to sugar canes.~~&#xD;
"There's no need of it, either" said Faith laughing,--.&#xD;
"for you can sing if I can't."&#xD;
"No, there is rio need of it, and therefore-Now, little&#xD;
bird, will you please hot to fly past the outlet of Kildeer&#xD;
river ?"&#xD;
Laughing, coloring, Faith nevertheless bent a very&#xD;
earnest attention upon this diffictat piece of navigation.&#xD;
For the opening of Kildeer river was as yet but slightly to&#xD;
be discerned ;-a little break in the smooth shore hine,-a&#xD;
very little atmospheric change in the soft leafy hues of the&#xD;
nearer and further point. iFaith watched, a.s only a young&#xD;
steersman does, for the time and place where her rudder&#xD;
should begin to take cognizance of the approaching change&#xD;
of course., A little wider the break in the shore line grew,&#xD;
-more plain the mark of a break in the trees,-.--.and almost&#xD;
suddenly the little stream unfolded its pretty reach of water&#xD;
and woodland, stretching in alluringly wit.h picturesque&#xD;
turns of its mimic channel. Faith needed a little help now,'&#xD;
&#xD;
for the river was not everywhere navigable; but after a&#xD;
few minutes of pretty sailing among care-requiring rocks&#xD;
and sand-banks, where the loss of wind made their pro-&#xD;
gress slow, the little skiff was safely brought to land at a&#xD;
nice piece of gravelly shore. It was wonderful pretty!&#xD;
The trees with their various young verdure came down to&#xD;
the water's edge, with many a dainty tint; here one covered&#xD;
with soft catkins of flower,-there one ruddy with not yet&#xD;
opened buds. The winding banks of the stream on one&#xD;
hand; and on the other the little piece of it they had&#xD;
passed' over, with the breadth of the Mong beyond.&#xD;
Through all, May's air and Spring's perfume, and the still.&#xD;
ness of noonday.&#xD;
"Inverled in the tide&#xD;
Stand the grey rocks, and trembling shadows throw,&#xD;
And the fair trees look over, side by side,&#xD;
And see themselves below." ~&#xD;
So Mr. Linden told Faith, as he was putting hissail in&#xD;
trim repose, and then-telling her that the guiding power&#xD;
was still in her hands, requested to know what they should&#xD;
do next.           )&#xD;
"Why," said Faith merrily, "I thought you had business&#xD;
to attend to ?"&#xD;
"I had -" said Mr. Linden,-" but I reflected that you&#xD;
would probably give me full occupation, and so got rid of&#xD;
the business first."&#xD;
"Then you have nothing to do here ?"&#xD;
"A great deal, 12 suppose; but I know not what."&#xD;
Faith fairly sat down to laugh at him.&#xD;
"What do you think of having lunch, and then going&#xD;
after flowers ?"&#xD;
"I consider that to be a prudent, bird-like suggestion.&#xD;
Do you expect me to cook this fish for you? or will you be&#xD;
content to take it home to your mother, and let us feast&#xD;
upon-.--.&#xD;
"'herbs, and such like country messes,&#xD;
Which neat-handed Phyllis dresses' ?"&#xD;
"Have you all the books in the world in yoi~r head ?"-&#xD;

plain it is Mr. Linden has nothing to do to-day ! -Would&#xD;
you like to help me gather some sticks for a fire, sir? j&#xD;
think you had better have something on your hands."&#xD;
"Do you ?" he said lifting her out~of the boat in his&#xD;
curiously quick, strong, light way,.-." that was something&#xD;
on my hands-not much. What next ?-do you say we are&#xD;
to play Ferdinand and Miranda ?"&#xD;
Faith's eye for an instant looked its old look, of grave,&#xD;
intelligent, doubtful questioning; but then she came back&#xD;
to Kildeer river.&#xD;
"I haven't played that play yet," she said gaily; "but&#xD;
if you'll help me find some dry sticks-.-.-your reward shall&#xD;
be that you shall not have what you don't like! I can make&#xD;
a fire nicely here, Endecott; on this rock."&#xD;
"Then it was ~ot about them you were reading in that&#xD;
focus of sunbeams ?"&#xD;
"What ?-" she said, Ipoking.&#xD;
"Once upon a time-.-" Mr. Linden said smiling,-" when&#xD;
you and Shakspeare got lost in the sunlight, and wandered&#xD;
about without in the least knowing where you were. '~&#xD;
"When, Endecott ?"&#xD;
"Leave that point," he said,-!' I want to tell you about&#xD;
the story. Ferdinand, whom I represent, was a prince cast&#xD;
away upon a desert shore-which shore was inhabited by&#xD;
the princess Miranda, whom you represent. Naturally&#xD;
enough, in the course of time, they came to think of each&#xD;
other much as we do - perhaps 'a little more so' on the&#xD;
part of Miranda. But then Miranda's father set Ferdinand&#xD;
to carrying wood,-as you-.-acting conscientiously for Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick-do me."&#xD;
"I wonder if I ever shall understand you !" exclaimed&#xD;
Faith desperately, as her laugh again broke upon the sweet&#xD;
air that floated in from the Mong. "What has my cone&#xD;
science, or Mrs. Derrick, to do with our lunch fire? Why&#xD;
was the other prince set to carrying wood ?"&#xD;
"For the same reason that I am !" said Mr. Linden raise&#xD;
ing his eyebrows. "To prove his affection for Miranda."&#xD;
How Faith laughed.&#xD;
"You are mistaken-O how mistaken you are !" she&#xD;
exclaimed. "It shews that though you know books, you&#xD;
don't know everything."&#xD;
&#xD;
And running away with her own armful of sticks and&#xD;
leaves, back to th~ rock spoken of near where the vessel&#xD;
lay, Faith was stopped and relieved of her load, with such&#xD;
an earnest-&#xD;
"'No, precious creature,&#xD;
I'd rather crack my ~inews, break my back,&#xD;
Than you should suc~i dishonour undergo'-"&#xD;
that she could do nothing but laugh, till the sticks were&#xD;
fairly on the rock. Then Paith went to laying them dain-&#xD;
tily together.&#xD;
"I hope you've no objection to my making the fire," she&#xD;
said; "because I like it. Only, Endecott! the matches are&#xD;
in the basket. Could you get them for me? Indeed I shall&#xD;
want the basket too out of the boat."&#xD;
Whereupon Mr. Linden-&#xD;
"'The very instant that I saw you, did&#xD;
My heart fly to your service; there reside,&#xD;
To make me slave to it; and for your sake,&#xD;
Am I this patient log man' I-"&#xD;
But anything less like those two last words than the~way&#xD;
in which he sprang into the boat, and brought the basket,&#xD;
and got out what she called for, could hardly be.&#xD;
"How many matches do you want ?" he said, looking&#xD;
demurely at her as he gave her one.&#xD;
"All of them,-basket and all, Endecott. .You are so&#xD;
patient that you do not hear."&#xD;
"And you so impatient that you do not see -'basket&#xD;
and all' are' at your side, fair princess..-Stand back,-it&#xD;
may be very well for the winds to 'blow, and crack their&#xD;
cheeks,' but I think it should be confined to them." And&#xD;
she was laughingly held back, where she could only use her&#xD;
eyes about the fire.&#xD;
"That's my province," said Faith. "I think any effort&#xD;
to make a princess of me, will-fail. Did Miranda pick&#xD;
up any wood herself?"&#xD;
"You can't help being a princess if I am a prince," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"I don't see how it follows," said Faith. "Only let me&#xD;

get at that fire, and the fancy will pass away. End ecott!&#xD;
-it is absolutely necessary that some wood should be put&#xD;
on; and I don't believe princes know how."&#xD;
"Princes," said Mr. Linden, holding her a little off with&#xD;
one hand, while with the other he replenished the fire, "are&#xD;
especially famed for their power of doing impossible things&#xD;
in desert places. And the princess will follow-whether&#xD;
you can see it or not. Is that blaze aspiring enough for&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"Yes, but it needs to be kept up-I want a good bed of&#xD;
coals."&#xD;
A fine fire was on its way at last, and while waiting for&#xD;
it to burn down to the desired bed of coals, the temporary&#xD;
prince and princess sat down on the rock to feast their eyes&#xD;
in the mean time. A little past midday, it was not the pic-&#xD;
turesque hour for another season; but now, in the freshness&#xD;
of Spring, the delicate beauties of colour and light could&#xD;
bear the full meridian sun and not ask for shadows to set&#xD;
them off; other than the tender shade under the half-leaved&#xD;
trees. It was a warm enough day too, and those same&#xD;
leaves were making a great spring towards their full unfold-&#xD;
ing. Birds were twittering all around, and they only filled&#xD;
up the silence.&#xD;
"Isn't it worth coming for ! -.-." said Faith, when they&#xD;
had taken it all in for a few minutes without interrupting&#xD;
the birds.&#xD;
"More than that-and the 'it' is very plural. Faith, do&#xD;
you see that butterfly ?" -A primrose-winged rower was&#xD;
meandering about in the soft air before them, flitting over&#xD;
the buttercups with a listless sort of admiration.&#xD;
"Poor thing, he has come out too soon," said Faith.&#xD;
"He will have some frost yet, for 'so summery as it is to-&#xD;
day." But Faith gave a graver look at the butterfly than&#xD;
his yellow wings altogether warranted.&#xD;
"Among the ancients," said Mr. Linden, "the word for&#xD;
a butterfly and the word for the soul were the same,-they&#xD;
thought the first was a good emblem of the lightness and&#xD;
airiness of the last. So they held, that when a~man died&#xD;
a butterfly might be seen flitting above his head. I was&#xD;
thinking how well this one little thing ahewa the exceeding&#xD;
lowness of heathen ideas."&#xD;

"I suppose so-or thought they dicL lint look at that&#xD;
creature's wavering, unsteady flight; his aimless wander-&#xD;

may know, even in this life,-compare it with the swift&#xD;
'return to God who gave it'-with the being 'caught up to&#xD;
meet the Lord' which it shall surely know at death."&#xD;
"And the butterfly isn't further from that," said Faith&#xD;
clasping her hands together,-" than many a real,'Iiving&#xD;
soul in many a living person !"-&#xD;
"No, not further; and so what the old Greeks made an&#xD;
emblem of the immortal soul, gives name, with us, to those&#xD;
persons who are most tied down to mortality. What were&#xD;
you thinking of; a minute ago, when I showed you the&#xD;
butterfly?"&#xD;
"I was thinking of son~ebody that I am afraid a butter~&#xD;
11&#xD;
fly will always remind me of;"-Faith answered with a slight&#xD;
colour ;-" and of the time he got the name."&#xD;
"He got it by favour of his office7 you know-not other-&#xD;
wise."&#xD;
''I know-"&#xD;
But with that, Faith jumped up to see to the state of the  p&#xD;
fire; and then after some conjuration in her basket pro-&#xD;
duced a suspicious-looking tin vessel, for which the proper&#xD;
bed of coals was found. Leaving it and the fire to agree ~&#xD;
together, Faith came back to the rock and Mr. Linden and&#xD;
stood a little while silently looking and breathing the&#xD;
sweetness.&#xD;
"I always did love everything in the world, that my eyes&#xD;
could see," she said gravely. "But I love them so much~&#xD;
more now !-now that th~ hand that made them is not such&#xD;
a strange far-off hand to me. It makes a kind of new&#xD;
world to me, Endecott." how-even&#xD;
"Yes - and you can understand             without&#xD;
physical changes-when we 'shall know as we are known,'&#xD;

back to her fire; and after a short space called to Mr&#xD;
Linden to ask if he would like to come and sec what the&#xD;
prince had been picking up wood for?&#xD;
To which the prince responded with very un~roya1 ~lac.&#xD;
rity, bringing a well-put..together knot of buttercups to&#xD;
adorn one side of Miranda's head; which he declared&#xD;
looked better than gold beads, if they didn't cost as&#xD;
much.&#xD;
A napkin was spread on the rock, conveniently near to&#xD;
the fire; on which plates and bread and a bottle of crean~&#xD;
and a dainty looking pasty were ~irregularly bestowed.&#xD;
Mr. Linden threw himself down on the moss; and Faith&#xD;
had got a cup and saucer out of her basket and was just&#xD;
sugaring and creaming the prince's reward before applying&#xD;
to her dish on the fire for the crowning coffee; when her&#xD;
eye was caught' by a spectator lately come upon the scene,&#xD;
No other than a somewhat ragged little boy, who eyeing&#xD;
them from the bank had been irresistibly lured nearer and&#xD;
nearer, by the grace of the preparations and the steam of&#xD;
the hot coffee perhaps, till he now stood by the trunk of&#xD;
the nearest tree.&#xD;
"What are you doin'?" he said.&#xD;
"What are you ?" said Mr. Linden, turning to look at&#xD;
the boy-not just as he looked at the coffee, but very much&#xD;
as the coffee looked at him. "Did you never see people&#xD;
eat dinner ?"&#xD;
The boy stood his ground with, "What you got ?"&#xD;
"When was the last time ?" said Mr. Linden. ("Princess&#xD;
...this may turn out to be a subject I")&#xD;
"Last time what?" said the 'subject' stoutly.&#xD;
"The last time you saw people eating dinner," said Mr.&#xD;
Linden. "Did you ever go to the Museum ?"&#xD;
"I've went to Pettibaug !"-&#xD;
"When is the last time you saw people eating dinner ~&#xD;
said Faith.&#xD;
"We haint got none to our house."&#xD;
"What's the matter?"&#xD;
"Mintie said there warn't nothing' to eat and I might go&#xD;
a blaekberryin'."&#xD;
"You've come to the rigjKt place," said Mr. Linden,-&#xD;
"I don't believe they're ripe anywhere else. Who is&#xD;
&#xD;
'Mintie'? and who stays with her while you're after&#xD;
blackberries ?"&#xD;
"Mintie's sissy. There aint nobody staying' with her.-.&#xD;
she's staying' along 0' mother-when she's up."&#xD;
"Where is she ?-I mean where does she live-and you,&#xD;
and Mintie. Where is your house ?"&#xD;
"Round there-'Taint fur. What you got ?"&#xD;
Faith set down her cup and looked at Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"What is the matter with your mother ?"&#xD;
"She's sick."&#xD;
"Well if I give you a basket, and this lady puts some&#xD;
dinner in it for your mother and Mintie and you, do you.&#xD;
think you can carry it home ?"&#xD;
"Is your sister sick too ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"She's got the fever nao~ur"&#xD;
"Endecott," said Faith softly,-" shall we go and see&#xD;
them ?"&#xD;
"Yes, of course. What's your name, child ?"&#xD;
"My name's Bob Tuck."&#xD;
Mr. Linden looked at him.&#xD;
"How comes it that you and Dromy are no more alike ~&#xD;
he said.&#xD;
"Mother says Dromy aint like nothing . I be."&#xD;
"Well Bob Tuck," said Mr. Linden smiling, "have you.&#xD;
got a broom at home ?"&#xD;
" There's two old ones."&#xD;
"Then if you will go home and sweep the floor as well&#xD;
ag you can, with the two old brooms, and set the table, I'll&#xD;
bring this lady to see you and we'll carry th~ basket-&#xD;
(which means, Princess, that I will !)-and you can let&#xD;
the blackberries hang on till they get ripe. Do you under-&#xD;
stand ?"&#xD;
"If I'll sweep the floor, you'll fetch the basket ?" said&#xD;
Bob.&#xD;
"Yes. And you can wash your hands nicely and be&#xD;
ready to help me take the things out of it."&#xD;
Bob started. "How soon '11 you come?"&#xD;
"As soon as I finish my dinner."&#xD;
"How good it is I brought the whole pie !" said Faith,&#xD;
as she poured the cfelayed coffee upon the cream and sugar.&#xD;

take that home, and we'll send something else..-.-.Yow you&#xD;

"I see-" Mr. Linden said, looking at her. "And you&#xD;
see, Princess, what royafty is apt to meet if ~t will go&#xD;
wandering round the world."&#xD;
"What?"&#xD;
"Bob Tuck!-"&#xD;
"Well-it's a good thing for Bob Tack to meet with&#xD;
royalty,"-said Faith, looking at the pie Mr. Linden was&#xD;
cutting.&#xD;
"Princess," said Mr. Linden, "have you any 'Queen&#xD;
Anne' in your basket ?"&#xD;
Faith looked, her merry, puzzled, grave look of inquiry,&#xD;
.-.and then there was nothing for it but a ringing laugh&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"I would rather have that at a venture, if I were the&#xD;
sick one," said Mr. Linden. "But the specific most prized&#xD;
by that class of the population who have 'fever nagur', is&#xD;
called in their vernacular 'Queen Anne ~~~.anglic6, quinine.&#xD;
Faith, you have no idea how those buttercups are beau.&#xD;

"Flowers always are, that you handle," said Faith.&#xD;
"You see how appropriate they are to my Sunbeam&#xD;
-for&#xD;
'The buttercup catches the sun in his chalice '."&#xD;
"What is a chalice ?"&#xD;
"A sort of cup-a church service cup, generally. Did&#xD;
you admire so much the head of clover I gave you once&#xD;
down at the shore ?"&#xD;
Faith gave him a curious glance of recollection; but&#xD;
though there was a half smile on her face too, she remained&#xD;
silent.&#xD;
"Well, little bird ?" he said smiling. "Of what is that&#xD;
look compounded ?"&#xD;
"Various things, I suppose. Let me have your cup,&#xD;
Endecott ?"&#xD;
"Do you know," he said, "that for a scholar, you are-&#xD;
remarkably-unready to answer questions ?"&#xD;
"I didn't know it."&#xD;
"Are not aware of any class of collective remarks or&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
inquiries which now and then break forth, and which' you&#xD;
invariably smother with a thick blanket of silence 7"&#xD;
There was another quick glance and smile, and then&#xD;
Faith said as she handed him his cup,-&#xD;
"What do you want to know, Endecott ?"&#xD;
"I want to know where there was ever just such. another&#xD;
princess. And by the way, speaking of the shore-I have&#xD;
something that belongs to her."&#xD;
"To me?"&#xD;
"Oni, mademoiselle."&#xD;
"May I know what?"&#xD;
"You may, yet not just now. You may guess what&#xD;
it is."&#xD;
But Faith gave up guessing in despair at one of Mr.&#xD;
Linden's puzzles.&#xD;
The basket was repacked when the lunch was done; and&#xD;
they set out on their walk. The way, following Bob's&#xD;
direction, led along the bank under the trees, turning a lit-&#xD;
tle before the Mong was reached. The house was soon&#xD;
found; standing alone, in an enclosed garden ground&#xD;
where no spade had been struck that season; and at the&#xD;
end of a farm road that showed no marks of travel.&#xD;
Bob had not only swept the room, but his tidings had&#xD;
roused apparently his sister to prepare herself also; for&#xD;
Mintie met them as they came in. She was a handsome&#xD;
girl, with a feverish colour in her cheeks that made her&#xD;
appearance only more striking. There was pride and&#xD;
poverty here, clearly. Faith's simple words neither as-&#xD;
sumed the one nor attacked the other. The girl looked&#xD;
curiously at her and at 'the other visitor.&#xD;
"Who be you?"&#xD;
"We do not live in this neighbourhood," said Faith.&#xD;
"We came up to Kildeor river to-day, and met your little&#xD;
brother down by the shore."&#xD;
"What did he say to you 7"&#xD;
"Ho told us you were sick and in want of help."&#xD;
Another look laid the girl's jealousy asleep. She told&#xD;
her story-her father had died six months ago; she and&#xD;
her mother and brother lived there alone. It was an "un-&#xD;
likely place to get to," and no neighbours very near. Her&#xD;
mother had been sick abed for a number of weeks; and&#xD;

she had had all t~ do, and now for a week past had been&#xD;
unable to do anything, go to Pettibaug or anywhere else,&#xD;
to get what they wanted. And so they "had got out of&#xD;
'most everything." Promy Tuck, Mr. Linden's scholar,&#xD;
lived at Farmer Davids' in the capacity of farm..boy~'; Mrs.&#xD;
Davids being a far-off connexion.&#xD;
So much was all pride permitted to be told. Without&#xD;
much questioning, her visitors contrived to find out what&#xD;
they could do for her. Faith put the coffee-pot on the&#xD;
fire, declaring that it would do Mintie good like medicine;&#xD;
and served it to her when it was hot, with some bread and&#xD;
chicken, as if it had been indeed medicine and Faith a&#xD;
doctor. Then while Bob and she were dining, Faitl~ went&#xD;
in to see the sick woman. She was much more commiini.&#xD;
captive, and half avowed that sh~ believed what she wanted&#xD;
now was "nourishing things "-"but with me lyin' here on&#xD;
my back," she said, "'taint so easy to find 'em." Faith&#xD;
gave her a cup of coffee too and some bread; she had&#xD;
hardly drunk any herself at lunch; and leaving her patient&#xD;
much inspirited, came back to Mr. Linden in the other&#xD;
room. Apparently his words and deeds had been accept.&#xD;
ble too,-Bob's face was shining, not only with dinner but&#xD;
with the previous cold water applications which Mr. Linden&#xD;
had insisted on, and Mintie's mind was evidently at work&#xD;
upon various things. The basket was soon emptied of all&#xD;
but its dishes, and the prince and princess went on their&#xD;
way down the hill.&#xD;
"Faith," said Mr. Linden, "shall we go and sit in the&#xD;
boat for half an hour, considering various things, and theii&#xD;
have our wild flower hunt? Or would you prefer that&#xD;
first ?"&#xD;
"0 no! I would rather have the half hour in the&#xD;
boat."&#xD;
It was good time yet in the afternoon, and though the&#xD;
little boat now lay partly shadowed by the hill, it was none&#xD;
the worse resting place for that. Again Faith was seated&#xD;
there in all the style that shawls and cushions furnished,&#xD;
and just tired enough to feel luxurious in the soft atmo~&#xD;
sphere. Mr. Linden arranged and established her to his&#xD;
liking; then he took out of his pocket a letter.&#xD;
It was one which had been opened and read; but as ho&#xD;
&#xD;
I7&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
unfolded it, there appeared another-unopened, unread; its&#xD;
dainty seal unbroken, and on the back in fair tracery, the&#xD;
words, "Miss Faith Derrkk." As Faith read theni and&#xD;
saw the hand, her eye glanced first up at Mr. Linden with&#xD;
its mute burden of surprise, and then the roses bloomed&#xD;
oat over her cheeks and even threw their flush upon her&#xD;
brow. Her eye was cast down now and fixed on the&#xD;
unopened letter, with the softest fall of its eyelid.&#xD;
"Shall I read you a part of mine first?"&#xD;
"If you please. I wish you would."&#xD;
"Only a little bit,'~ he said smiling-thinking perhaps&#xD;
that she did not know to what she gave her assent so&#xD;
readily,-"you shall read the whole of it another time."&#xD;
The "little bit" began rather abruptly.&#xD;
"'I have written to your darling, Endy Not much, tell&#xD;
her; because what I have in my heart for her cannot be&#xD;
told. I know how precious any one must be whom you&#xD;
love so much. But make her love me a little before she&#xD;
reads my letter-and don't let her call me anything but&#xD;
Pet-and then I shall feel as if I had a sister already.&#xD;
And so I have, as you say. What a glad word !-I could&#xD;
cry again with the very writing of it.&#xD;
'Endy-I did cry a little over your letter, but only for&#xD;
joy: if it had been for sorrow I should have cried long&#xD;
ago; for I knew well enough what was coming. Only I&#xD;
want more than ever to be at home,-and to see you, and&#xD;
to see Faith.-don't let her think I am like you!&#xD;
'My letter wouldn't hold much, as I told iou. But I&#xD;
give you any number of (unspeakable!) messages for her,&#xD;
John Endy. I suppose you will take charge of them? I&#xD;
may feel sure they have all reached their destination ?"'&#xD;
Long before the reading was finished, Faith's head had&#xD;
sunk-almost to the cushions beside her. The reader's&#xD;
voice and intonation had given every word a sort of ring&#xD;
in her heart, though the tone ~vas low. One hand came&#xD;
round her when she put her head down, taking possession&#xD;
of her hand which lay so still, with the unopened letter in&#xD;
its clasp. But now she was gently raised up.&#xD;
"Precious child," Mr. Linden said, ~' what are you droop-&#xD;
ing your head for ?"&#xD;
"For the same reason she had, I suppose,-" said Faith&#xD;

half laughing, though witnesses of another kind were in her&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
"Who are you talking about ?"&#xD;
"Your sister."&#xD;
"Why don't you begin to practise your lesson 'p"&#xD;
Perhaps Faith thought that she was. She looked at&#xD;
nothing hut her letter.&#xD;
"Will you wait for your messages till we get home ?-..&#xD;
this place not being absolute seclusion."&#xD;
"Shall I read this now ?" said Faith rather hastily.&#xD;
"I should think there would be no danger in that."&#xD;
With somewhat unsteady fingers, that yet tried to be&#xD;
quiet, Faith broke the seal; and masking her glowing face&#xD;
with one hand, she bent over the letter to read it.&#xD;
"My very dear, and most unknown, and most well.&#xD;
known little sister! I have had a picture sent me of you&#xD;
-as you appeared one night, when you sat for your por.&#xD;
trait, hearing Portia; and with it a notice of several events&#xD;
which occurred just before that time. And both picture&#xD;
and events have gone down into my heart, and abide there.&#xD;
Endecott says you are a Sunbeam-and I feel as if a little&#xD;
of the light had come over the water to me,-ever since&#xD;
his letter came I have been in a state of absolute reflex.&#xD;

know that there is nobody in the world just like him? be.&#xD;
cause if you do not-you will find it out !-I mean! like&#xD;
Endecott.~-not like Love. My dear, I beg pardon for my&#xD;
pronoun! But just how I have loved you all these months,&#xD;
for making him so happy, I cannot tell you.&#xD;
"And I cannot write to-day---about anything, -my&#xD;
thoughts are in too uneven a flow to find their way to the&#xD;
end of my pen, and take all possible flights instead. Pea?.&#xD;
Faith, you must wait for a letter till the next steamer.&#xD;
And you cannot miss it-nor anything else, with Endecott&#xD;
there, ~-it seems to me that to be even in the same country&#xD;
with h~m is happiness.&#xD;

Faith took a great deal more time than was necessary&#xD;
for the reading of this letter. Very much indeed she&#xD;
would have liked to do as her correspondent confessed she&#xD;
had done, and cry-but there was no sign of such an in~&#xD;
declination. She only sat perfectly moveless, bending over&#xD;
her letter. At last suddenly looked up and gave it to&#xD;
Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Well ?" he said with a smile at her as he took i~j.&#xD;
"You'll see-" she said, a little breathlessly. A~ still&#xD;
holding her hand fast, Mi'. Linden read the letter, quicker&#xD;
than she had done, and without comment-unless when his&#xD;
look showed that it touched him.&#xD;
"You will love her, Faith !" he said as he folded the&#xD;
letter up agai~~,-"in spite of all your inclinations to the&#xD;
contrary 1"&#xD;
"Do you think that is in the future tense? But I am&#xD;
afraid~" added Faith,-" she thinks too much of me now."&#xD;
"She does not think as much of you as I do," Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den. said, with a look and smile that covered all the ground&#xD;
of present or future fear. "And after all it is a danger&#xD;
which you will share with me. It is one of Pet's loveable&#xD;
failings to think too much of some people whom she loves&#xD;
~ just enough&#xD;
~: humility is not a fearful thing. Whatever had been in&#xD;
Faith's speech, her look, bright, wistful, and happy, had no&#xD;
fear, truly humble though it was. "There is no danger of&#xD;
~ my loving this letter too much "- she said as she carefully&#xD;
restored it to its envelope; said with a secret utterance of&#xD;
great gratification.&#xD;
The promised half hour was much more than up, and&#xD;
broadening shadow on Kildeer river said that the time&#xD;
which could be given to wild flowers was fast running&#xD;
away. Perhaps, too, Mr. Linden thought Faith had mused&#xD;
and been excited enough, for he made a move. Everything&#xD;
in the boat was put up in close order, and then the two&#xD;
* went ashore again, flower basket in hand.&#xD;
The long shadows heightened the beauty of the woods&#xD;
now, falling soft and brown upon the yet browner carpet&#xD;
of dry leaves, and the young leaves and buds overhead&#xD;
shexved every tint, from yellow to green. Under the trees&#xD;

&#xD;
fleecy sterns, and azalia in rosy pink; and the real wild&#xD;
flowers-the dainty things as wild in growth as in flame,&#xD;
were sprinkled everywhere. Wind flowers and columbine;&#xD;
orchis sweet as any hyacinth; tall Solomon's seal; spotless&#xD;
bloodroot; and violets -white, yellow, and purple. The&#xD;
dogwood stretched its white arms athwart hemlock and&#xD;
service; the creeping partridge berry carried its perfumed&#xD;
white stars over rocks and moss in the deep shade below,&#xD;
Yellow bellwort hung its fair flowers on every ridge;&#xD;
where the ground grew wet were dog's-tooth violet and&#xD;
chick wintergreen. There the red maples stood, with&#xD;
bunches of crimson keys,-at the edge of the higher&#xD;
ground their humbler growing sister the striped bark,&#xD;
waved her green tresses. There seemed to be no end to&#xD;
the flowers-nor to the variety-nor to the pleasure of&#xD;
picking.&#xD;
"Faith-" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
Faith looked up from a bunch of Sanguinaria beside&#xD;
which she was crouching.&#xD;
"I find so much Mignonette !-do you ?"&#xD;
Faith's eye flashed, and taking one of those little white&#xD;
stars she threw it towards Mr~ Linden. It went in ti&#xD;
graceful parabolic curve and fell harmlessly, like her cour-&#xD;
age, at his feet.&#xD;
"What has become of the princess ?"&#xD;
"You ought rather to ask after the prince !" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden, picking up the Sanguinaria with great devotion.&#xD;
"Is this the Star of the Order of Merit ?"&#xD;
"I am not Queen Flora. I don't know."&#xD;
"As what then was it bestowed ?"&#xD;
"It might be Mignonette's shield, which she used as a&#xD;
weapon because she hadn't any other! Eudy, look at those&#xD;
green Maple flowers! You can reach them."&#xD;
He gathered some of the hanging clusters, and then&#xD;
came and sat down where she was at work and began to&#xD;
put them into her basket, arranging and dressing the other&#xD;
flowers the while dextrously.&#xD;
"Do you know, my little Sunbeam," he said, "that your&#xD;
namesakes are retreating?"&#xD;
"I know it, Endy," she said hastening her last gather-&#xD;
ings-" and I am ready."&#xD;
&#xD;
They began their homeward way to the boat, wandering&#xD;
a little still, for flowers, and stopping to pick them, so that&#xD;
the sun was quite low before Kildeer river was reached.&#xD;
There Mr. Linden stood a moment looking about.&#xD;
"Do you see the place where we sat, Faith ?" he said,&#xD;
~" over on the other bank?"&#xD;
She looked, and looked at him and smiled-very differ~&#xD;
ent from her look then! A glance comprehensive and&#xD;
satisfactory enough without words, so without any more&#xD;
words they went on their way along the shore of the river.&#xD;
As they neared their boat, the rays of the setting sun&#xD;
were darted into ICildeer river and gilded the embayed&#xD;
little vessel and all the surrounding shores. Rocks and&#xD;
trees and bits of land glowed or glistened in splendour&#xD;
wherever a point or a spray could catch the sun; th~&#xD;
water in both rivers shone with a long strip of gold.&#xD;
They had had nothing so brilliant all day.&#xD;
In the full glow and brightness Faith sat down in the&#xD;
boat with her flowers near her, and Mr. Linden loosened&#xD;
the sail. How pretty the bank looked as they were leav~&#xD;
ing it! the ashes of their fire on the rock, and the places&#xD;
where they had sat or wandered, and talked-such happy&#xD;
words!&#xD;
"I shall always love Kildeer river," said Faith with;&#xD;
little long breath, "because I read my letter here."&#xD;
"And so shall I," said Mr. Linden,-" but my love for it&#xD;
dates back to the first piece of reading I ever did in its&#xD;
company." He looked back for a minute or two-at the.&#xD;
one shore and the other-the sunlight, the trees, the&#xD;
flowery hillside, an~l it was well then that his face was&#xD;
not seen by Faith-there fell on it such a shadow of pain.&#xD;
But he presently turned to her again with just the former&#xD;
look.&#xD;
"Now," he said, "do you think you can steer home in&#xD;
the twilight ?"&#xD;
"I don't know. Can 1? 1 can follow directions."&#xD;
"And I can give them."&#xD;
And with that arrai~ernent they ran out from the clean&#xD;
woody shores of. Kildeer river, and set their sail for Patta-&#xD;
quasset. How fair, at that point of weather and day! a&#xD;
little quieter than the morning spring-tide of everything,&#xD;

but what was less gay was more peaceful; and against ~&#xD;
soft south wind the little boat began to beat her way dowij,&#xD;
favoured however by the tide. These tacks made Mr.&#xD;
Linden's counsels more especially needed, but the short&#xD;
swift runs back and forth across the river were even more&#xD;
inspiriting than a steady run before the wind, and the con.&#xD;
stant attention which helm and sail reqi~iired made talk and&#xD;
action lively enough.&#xD;
"This is good, Endecott!" said Faith as the little boat&#xD;
came about for the fifth or sixth time.&#xD;
"Faith," he said, smiling at her, "you look just as fresh&#xD;
as a rose !-the day does not seem to have tired you one&#xD;
"Tired !" she said,.-"yes, I am a little bit tired-or&#xD;
hungry-but was there ever such a day as we have had ?~&#xD;
since the first of January !"&#xD;
"My dear little Mignonette I" Mr. Linden said-but if&#xD;
it was a 'message' Faith had then, it came from some-&#xD;
where nearer than across the water. "If you are tired,&#xD;
dear child, give up the rudder to me, and lay down your&#xD;
head and rest. Do you see after what a sleep-inviting&#xD;
fashion the lights are twinkling all down the shore ?"&#xD;
"I'm not sleepy a bit;" said Faith,-" nor tired, except&#xD;
just enough; and I like this small portion of power you&#xD;
have put in my hands. How beautiful those lights look I&#xD;
.-and the lights overhead, ~Eudy. How beautiful every-&#xD;
thing is I-."&#xD;
"Yes," said Mr. Linden, "when there is light within.-&#xD;
"'He that hath light within his own clear br~asL,&#xD;
May sit i' the centre and enjoy bright day.7"&#xD;
"That's beautiful !" said Faith after a pause.&#xD;
And now the brush andA stir of 'coming about' again&#xD;
claimed their attention, and in a minute more they were&#xD;
stretching away on a new tack, with another set of constel-&#xD;
lations opposite to them in the sky. The breeze was fresh,&#xD;
though as mild as May; the boat made good speed; and&#xD;
in spite of beating down the river the mouth of the&#xD;
Mong was neared fast. Pattaquasset lights, a little clus-&#xD;
ter of them, appeared unmistakably; for down by the point&#xD;
&#xD;
there was a little knot of houses, variously concerned in&#xD;
trade or fisheries. Mr. Linden had to put his hand upon&#xD;
the tiller sometimes then, till they got in. Mr. Skip and&#xD;
Jerry were in waiting; had been, "a sight o' ha&#xD;
the former stated. Baskets and shad         If hours,"&#xD;
and passengers were&#xD;
transferred to the wagon, and within a moderate 4ime&#xD;
thereafter welcomed (the latter) ~y Mrs. Derrick and s\ip-&#xD;
per-wherein, after a little delay therefore, the shad played&#xD;
a conspicuous and most satisfactory part.&#xD;
Now there are no shad like the shad that come out of&#xD;
the Mong.&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
S o passed the days. Not indeed all at Kildeer river,&#xD;
but all in sweet, peaceful, bright occupations, whether&#xD;
of work or play. The trustees had received their notic~&#xD;
with much dismay; a little alleviated by the fact that Mr.&#xD;
Linden was willing to stay at his post for a few weeks~ after&#xD;
the end of the year.&#xD;
It was almost a wonder, as the weeks went on, that Mr,&#xD;
Linden kept down the shadows as well as he did,.-to leave&#xD;
Faith in the morning, and go to his devoted set of scholars&#xD;
-every one of whom had some particular as well as gen.&#xD;
eral hold on him and love for him; and then to get away&#xD;
by the hardest from their words and looks of sorrow and&#xD;
regret, and come back to the presence of her brave lit.&#xD;
tie face-Mr. Linden was between two fires. And they&#xD;
wrought a sort of deepening of everything about him&#xD;
which was lovely or loveable-which did not make it easier&#xD;
for Pattaquasset to let him go.&#xD;
As far as anybody could be a help to him, Faith was&#xD;
one. In a gentleness of spirit that was of no kin to weak.&#xD;
ness, she took to her heart the good that she had, and was&#xD;
quite as much of a sunbeam as ever. How it would be&#xD;
when Mr. Linden was gone, Faith did not know; but she&#xD;
did know that that was one of to-morrow's cares, with&#xD;
which she had no business to-day. If the thought ever&#xD;
came up in its strength, strong enough to bring down her&#xD;
heart and head,-if there were times when Faith showed&#xD;
herself to herself-the revelation was made to no other&#xD;
person. And therefore it is probable that it was a view&#xD;
she did not often indulge in.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison was not much at Pattaquasset these days&#xD;
He found it convenient to be away.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison was a man who did not like to throw away&#xD;
his ammunition. He by no means absented himself because&#xD;
180)&#xD;
&#xD;
of any failing in his fancy for somebody in Pattaquasset;&#xD;
the working of cause and effect was on a precisely opposite&#xD;
principle. The truth was, the fancy had grown to a&#xD;
strength that would not well bear the doubtful kind of in-&#xD;
I tercourse which had been kept up between the parties;&#xD;
'yet doubtful it remained, and must remain for the present.&#xD;
With Mr. Linden there in the family; with the familiar&#xD;
habits that naturally grow up between hostess and guest,&#xD;
friend and friend, fellow inmates of the same house.-~-it was&#xD;
very difficult for the doctor to judge whether thosQ habits&#xD;
had any other and deeper groundwork. It was impossible,&#xD;
with his scanty and limited chances of observation. At&#xD;
the same time there was too great a possibility-his jeal-&#xD;
ousy called it more,.-for him to be willing to take any for-&#xD;
ward and undoubtful steps himself. He did not find sea-&#xD;
room to pift in his oar. In this state of things, all that&#xD;
hispride and his prudence would si}ffer him to do, was to&#xD;
wait-wait till either by Mr. Linden's stay or departure&#xD;
the truth might be made known. But to abide in Patta-&#xD;
quasset and watch patiently the signs of things, was more&#xD;
than Dr. Harrison's feeling,-.--for it was far more than&#xD;
fancy,-could bear. Just now, in despair or dis~st, he&#xD;
had taken a 'longer enterprise than usual; and was very&#xD;
far indeed from Pattaquasset when the news of Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den's going set all the country in a flame. So, greatly to&#xD;
Faith's satisfaction, he could not for some time be there to&#xD;
add any flame of his own.&#xD;
The morning readings with Mr. Linden were great and&#xD;
chief treasures to her all these days. She was always&#xD;
ready for him before six o'clock. Not now in a firelit&#xD;
room, with curtains drawn against the cold; but in the&#xD;
early freshness of the spring and summer mornings, with&#xD;
windows open and sweet air coming in. Duly Faith noted&#xD;
every "ladder of verses "-4111 her Bible grew to be well&#xD;
dotted with marks of red ink. They looked lovely to her&#xD;
eyes. So they might; for they were records of many very&#xD;
deep and sweet draughts from that well of water which&#xD;
the word is to tli2~m that love it; draughts deeper and&#xD;
sweeter than Faith could have drawn by herself.-or she&#xD;
thought so. No quarter of an hour in the day Faith loved&#xD;
so well. It was often more.&#xD;

&#xD;
One morning the "ladder" began with the silver trum.&#xD;
pets made for the service of God in the hands of the&#xD;
priests of Israel. Faith, looking quietly out of the win.&#xD;
dow, went roving in thought over the times and occasions&#xD;
Mr. Linden read of:, when their triumphal blast had pro.&#xD;
claimed the name and the glory of God in the ears of the&#xD;
thousands of Israel; times of rejoicing, of hope, of pro.&#xD;
mise and of victory. Scenes of glory in the old Jewish&#xD;
history floated before her-with the sublime faith of the&#xD;
actors in them, and the magnificent emblematic language&#xD;
in which they read the truth. Faith only came fairly&#xD;
back to New England and Pattaquasset at David's deem.&#xD;
ration.-.&#xD;
"Blessed are the people that know the joyful sound;&#xD;
they shall walk, '0 Lord, in the light of thy countenance."&#xD;
The words thrilled her. She thought of the many who&#xD;
had never heard the sound at all; and entered into Isaiah's&#xD;
foresight of a day when £4 the great trumpet shall be blown,&#xD;
and they shall come that were ready to perish in the land&#xD;
of Assyria, and the outcasts in the laud of Egypt."&#xD;
"How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him&#xD;
that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that&#xD;
bringeth good tidings of good; that publisheth salvation;&#xD;
that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth !"&#xD;
Then came Isaiah's own blast of the trumpet, and then&#xD;
the sweet enlargements and proclamations of the gospel~&#xD;
and the Lord's own invitation to all who are "weary a4&#xD;
heavy laden." But also-&#xD;
"How shall they call on him in whom they have not be.&#xD;
lived? and hc~w shall they believe in him of whom they&#xD;
have not heard? and how shall they hear without a&#xD;
preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be&#xD;
sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them&#xD;
that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of&#xD;
good things !"-.&#xD;
"And the Spirit and the bride say, CQme. And let&#xD;
him that hearth say, Come. And let him that is athirst&#xD;
come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life&#xD;
freely."&#xD;
Faith sat by the open window, no sound abroad but the&#xD;
stir in tho leaves and the low music of birds. The very&#xD;

&#xD;
~ti1l peace without, rather seemed to heighten and swell&#xD;
the moving of thoughts within, which surged like the sea.&#xD;
t Mr. Linden stopped reading and was silent; and so was&#xD;
she, with nothing of all this appearing otherwise than in&#xD;
~ the fixed, abstracted look which wenJ~ out into Patta~&#xD;
~quasset but also went far beyond. A§nd when she spoke,&#xD;
it was earnestly and with the same clear quiet.&#xD;
"Endy-I[ am glad to have you go, for the reason you&#xD;
are goIng for. I wouldn't have you be anything else than&#xD;
what you mean to be,-not for the pleasure of having you&#xD;
here."&#xD;
Her voice did not tremble, though indeed it told of feela&#xD;
logs that were less assured.&#xD;
"Dear Faith 1" Mr. Linden said, with a bright flash of&#xD;
pleasure at her words, which changed even while h~ spoke,&#xD;
"you do not know what a comfort it is to me to feel that!&#xD;
And do you realize, little Sunbeam, what joy it is, that&#xD;
however far apart we can still work together--in the same&#xD;
cause, for the same master? The work which I take upon&#xD;
me by name, belongs as really to you,.-.for the call should&#xD;
be given by every one that hearth to every one that is&#xD;
athirst."&#xD;
'I know-" she said quietly. "How grand those words&#xD;
are you have been reading !"&#xD;
"Faith," Mr. Linden said presently, "have you any&#xD;
special attachment to this particular little Bible ?"&#xD;
"I have my red notes in it," she said with a bright&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"1 am not quite satisfied with the paper and type, for&#xD;
your eyes-by firelight and twilight. Shall I break up&#xD;
any train of old association if I send you another ?"&#xD;
She gave him a look of what Dr. Harrison might have&#xD;
called "compound interest"; but assured him at the same&#xD;
time with sedate earnestness that the one she had would do&#xD;
very well.&#xD;
This was but a day or two before Mr. Linden's leaving&#xD;
Pattaquasset. He had paid his many farewell visits before&#xD;
the last week came, and before that, too, had given up his&#xD;
weekday ~cholars,..~Zthose last days were all given to Faith.&#xD;
Given to her in every possible way-out of doors and&#xD;

best of all places for talking, and the least liable to intra.&#xD;
sion. It was a great relief to get away from village sights&#xD;
and sounds to the still woods, or the fresh shore,.-it Was a&#xD;
great help towards cheerfulness. And the help was needed&#xD;
Wherever Mr. Linden went, among people, he met nothi~&#xD;
but sorrow for his going away,- wherever he went, to&#xD;
house or woods, he carried the deep-hidden double sorrow&#xD;
in his heart, which no one guessed of all who so loudly&#xD;
bewailed his departure. Faith herself perhaps hardly&#xD;
realized what his part of that sorrow was; but he knew&#xD;
hers, and bore it-as one bears the trials of the dearest&#xD;
friend one has on earth.&#xD;
lie was to go very early in the morning, but when the&#xD;
late evening talk had impinged upon the njght as much as&#xD;
it could be allowed to do, he gave Faith the unexpected&#xD;
promise of coming down to read with her just as usual&#xD;
next day.&#xD;
It was very, very early this time, in the summer twilight&#xD;
dawn, when the kildeers were in their fall burst of matins,&#xD;
and all the other birds coming in one by one. Faith did&#xD;
not say many words, butt she was as quiet as the hour.&#xD;
Then she went to, the breakfast-room to arrange and hasten&#xD;
matters there; and Mr. Linden followed, and stood watch.&#xD;
ing her-she did not know how,-she only knew how he&#xD;
talked.&#xD;
But he took her into the sitting-room the moment break-&#xD;
fast was over and stood by her, giving her the mute caresses&#xD;
he could not put in words. And for words there was little&#xD;
time. The morning light came up and up into the sky,&#xD;
the candles burned dim, as they stood there; and then he&#xD;
bade her "'be perfect, be of good comfort,"' and so went&#xD;
away.&#xD;

CHAPTER XJH.&#xD;
&#xD;
'IV lIEN Mr. Linden was out of sight from the porch,&#xD;
V    Faith went to the deserted room.&#xD;
It was in the latter end of summer. r1~he windows were&#xD;
open, and the summer wind blowing the muslin curtains&#xD;
flutteringly in. The maple shaded Faith's old reading&#xD;
window, the leaves not changing yet; one cupboard door&#xD;
a little open, showed the treasures of books within. The&#xD;
chintz couch stood empty, so it always stood when Faith&#xD;
saw it, except only in those days of Mr. Linden's confine-&#xD;
ment with his wound. But now her .mind leaped back to&#xD;
that time; and the couch and the table and the books, the&#xD;
very windows and fireplace, looked deserted. The red&#xD;
maple leaves floating' in-the dancing flames in the chim-&#xD;
ney-her lessons by the side of that couch-her first exer-&#xD;
cise, which she had been sent to do at that table ;-all that&#xD;
and everything beside seemed to make its passage through&#xD;
Faith's mind in tumultuous procession. She sat down on&#xD;
the couch and leaned her head on the back of it; but only&#xD;
a few nervous tears came, and oppressed sobbing breaths&#xD;
took the place of them. For a little while then Faith fell&#xD;
on her knees, and if she could not speak connectedly, nor&#xD;
think connectedly, she yet poured out her heart in the only&#xD;
safe channel; and grew quiet and self-possessed. After an&#xD;
hour she left The couch and turned to go down and join her&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
Passing the table on her way out, with a glance which&#xD;
had been called off by other things as she came in, Faith's&#xD;
eye was caught and stayed. There was no exercise left&#xD;
there for her, but the very gold pen with which she l~ad&#xD;
written that first one-~and which she had used so many&#xD;
thues since, lay there.; and by the pen a letter. The blood&#xD;
rushed to Faith's heart as if Mr. Linden had come back&#xD;
again, or rather as if he had not taken quite all of himselC&#xD;
away. In a flood of gladness and thankfulness and sorrow,&#xD;

Faith took up the letter and standing there by the table&#xD;
read it.&#xD;
"MY OWN LITTLE PUEOIOTJS MIO~N0N~TTE,&#xD;
I have a love for this sheet of paper, because it will be&#xD;
in your hands when I cannot touclv them nor see them,~.&#xD;
how often they have ministered to me just where I am&#xD;
writing this! just where you will find it. I know you will&#xD;
find it, Faith-I know where you will go as soon as I am&#xD;
out of sighy-but dear~child, do not let any sight or usso.&#xD;
citation in this room make you anything but glad: they are&#xD;
all very dear to me. rVhat first day when you came in&#xD;
here to see me-and all the days that followed,-and all&#xD;
the sweet knowledge I gained of my little Mignonette,&#xD;
while she was learning other things. Faith, I can even&#xD;
forgive Dr. harrison his questions that day, for the delight&#xD;
it was to me to shield you. Dear child, you must let me&#xD;
do that now whenever I can,-it is one of the griefs of this&#xD;
separation that I cannot do it all the time.&#xD;
I must go back to our Bible verses !-Do you remember&#xD;
that first 'ladder' we went up together? 'The Lord God&#xD;
is a sun and a shield; the Lord will give grace and glory.'&#xD;
-In that sunlight .1 shall think of you as al)idiIIg~-J will&#xD;
remember that you are covered by that shield. I know&#xD;
that the Lord will keep all that I have committed to him!&#xD;
1{ow darling, if I could leave you 'messages,' I would;&#xD;
but they must wait till I come and deliver them myself.&#xD;
Take, in the mean while, all possible love and trust; and&#xD;
all comfort from the cause of my absence, from our mutual&#xD;
work, from my expected coming home now and then-from&#xD;
the diamonds on your finger and what they betoken!&#xD;
The diamonds stay with you, Faith, but their light goes&#xD;
with inc.&#xD;
My child, I have too much to say to write any longer !-&#xD;
17 shall be drawn on too far and too long, -it is not far&#xD;
from daybreak now. Take thc best possible care of your-&#xD;
self, and 'be strong and of a good courage,' and 'the Lord&#xD;
that made heaven and earth, bless thee out of Zion'!&#xD;
Precious child, you do not know how deeply I am&#xD;
Always your own-&#xD;
ENDFJCOTT."~&#xD;
&#xD;
The first lines of the letter wrung some tears from&#xD;
Faith's eyes, but afterwards the effect of the whole was to&#xD;
shake her. She sat down on the couch with the let-&#xD;
ter fast in her hand, and hid her head; yet no weeping,&#xD;
only convulsive breaths and a straitened breast. Faith&#xD;
was wonderful glad of that letter! but the meeting of 'two&#xD;
tides is just hard to bear; and it wakened everything as&#xD;
well as gladness. However, in its time, that struggle was&#xD;
over too; and she went down to Mrs. Derrick looking much&#xD;
like her wanted self.&#xD;
She went about 5Oi all the day; nervously busy, though&#xD;
never more orderly about her business. In the kitchen and&#xD;
dairy and storeroom, a~nd with her mother, Faith seemed as&#xD;
usual, with a very little of grave thoughtfulness or remem-&#xD;
brance thrown over her natural pleasantness; only she&#xD;
gave books a wide berth, and took care to see no face that&#xD;
came to the house. One would have thought her-per-&#xD;
haps Mrs. Derrick even did - quietly composed and pa-&#xD;
tiently submitting to ti'ial, as if Mr. Linden had been&#xD;
already weeks away. Perhaps Faith4erself thought so.&#xD;
A little thing showed how' much this quiet was worth.&#xD;
The day had been gone through; the tea was over, as it&#xD;
migl~,y~Ath the two alone; and mother and daughter had&#xD;
gone into the other room. Faith lit the lamp, and then&#xD;
began a sentence to hQr mother about laying the Bible in&#xD;
its place for prayer-when she stopped short. For a mo-&#xD;
ment she stood still with the revulsion; then she fell on her&#xD;
knees and hid her face in Mrs. Derrick's lap, and the tears&#xD;
that had kept back so long came in a stormy flood; clearing&#xD;
the sky which had not been clear b~fore. Sh~ was quiet&#xD;
really after that; she had no more fear of her books; and&#xD;
the first thing Faith did was to take pen and paper and&#xD;
pour out an answer to her morning's letter; an answer in&#xD;
which she gave Mr. Linden the history of her whole day,&#xD;
with very little reservation.&#xD;
Her mother watched her,-sat and looked at her as she&#xD;
wrote, with eyes very glistening and tremulous in their fond&#xD;
admiration. Indeed that had been their character all day,&#xD;
though Mrs. Derrick had followed Faith in her busy work,&#xD;
with no attempt to check her, with no allusion to what they&#xD;
both thought of uninterruptedly. Now, however, that&#xD;

Faith's tears had made their own way, her mother's heart&#xD;
was easier; and she watched the pretty writer by~ the lamp&#xD;
with all sorts of sweet and tender thoughts.&#xD;
A' day or two passed, in great quiet and tender minister.&#xD;
ing to each other of the mother and daughter. Faith had&#xD;
taken deep hold of her studies again and every minute of&#xD;
the day was filled up as busily as ever. So the sitting-room&#xD;
wore in all things minus one its wanted aspect, when, the&#xD;
third evening, it received Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
He came in looking remarkably well, in his light dainty&#xD;
summer dress, and with~ that gentle carelessness of move.&#xD;
ment and manner that suited the relaxing persuasions of a&#xD;
hot summer day. He came in, too, a little like a person&#xD;
who through long absences has forgotten how wanted he&#xD;
used to be in a certain place or how fond he was of what&#xD;
he found there. Nothing further from the truth!&#xD;
'He accosted both ladies, after his usual gay fashion,&#xD;
and talked for a while about nothings and as if he cared&#xD;
about nothing. He could make nothing of Faith, except&#xD;
perhaps that she was a trifle shy of him. That did not&#xD;
mean evil necessarily; it was natural enough. lie wouldn't&#xD;
disturb her shyness!&#xD;
"I have a sympathetic feeling for you, Mrs. Derrick," he&#xD;
remarked. "I miss Mr. Linden so much in Pattaquasset,&#xD;
i think how you must do in the house."&#xD;
"No, doctor, you can't," was Mrs. Derrick's quiet&#xD;
rejoinder.&#xD;
"How do you ?"&#xD;
"Why I can't tell you, either," said Mrs. Derrick.&#xD;
"Mrs. Derrick," said the doctor, "I shouldn't like to be&#xD;
a lawyer and have to examine you as a witness. Unless it'&#xD;
wasn't August 1"&#xD;
"Well I suppose we should agree upon that, doctor,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Derrick. "I don'L know what August has to do&#xD;
with it."&#xD;
"My dear madam, it would be too much trouble !-Ap~&#xD;
patently it isn't August everywhere !".-A very peremptory&#xD;
rap at the front door came in the train of footsteps that&#xD;
were loud and brisk as by authority~ and that had quite&#xD;
survived the enervating effects referred to by the doctor.&#xD;
"Mi~ Faith," said Cindy appearing at the parlour door,&#xD;

"here's a man's got something-and he won't give it to me&#xD;
~jthout I'll take oath I'm you-which of course I dursn't.&#xD;
I'm free to confess, I can't even get sight of it. Shall I&#xD;
fetch him in-thing and all ?"&#xD;
Faith went to the door. It was nobody more terrific&#xD;
~than an express-mall, who seemed to recognize 'Miss Faith&#xD;
]ierrick' by instinct, for he asked no questions-only put a&#xD;
package into her hands, and then gave her his book' to&#xD;
sign. Faith signed her name, eagerly, and then' ran up&#xD;
stairs with her treasui'e and a beating heart, and struck a&#xD;
light.&#xD;
There was no need to ask where it came from -the&#xD;
address was plain enough; nor much need to ask what it&#xD;
was-she knew that it must be her Bible. Yet that only&#xD;
heightened the pleasure and interest, as she took off one&#xD;
wrapping paper after another, till its own beautiful morocco&#xD;
covers appeared. Within was the p rfcction. of type and&#xD;
paper, with here and there a flue map; in size and&#xD;
shape just that medium which seems to combine the excel-&#xD;
lencies of all the rest. There was no letter in the package,&#xD;
but a slip of paper with a new 'ladder of verses' marked&#xD;
the place where they began; and on the fly leaf, below the&#xD;
inscription, was written the first verse of the ninety-first&#xD;
psalm. This was the loadingfrefer~nce on the slip of&#xD;
paper.&#xD;
Has any one-with any heart-ever received such a&#xD;
package? To such a one there is no need to tell the glow&#xD;

Faith's heart and her face; to anybody else it's no use.&#xD;
She had to exercise some care to l)revellt certain witnesses&#xD;

enfolded her treasure, and then Faith went down stairs with&#xD;
the high colour of pleasure in her cheeks. The doctor took&#xD;
several observations.&#xD;

4 He had not been profiting by any opportunity to 'es.&#xD;
amine' Mrs. Derrick. On the contrary, he had talked&#xD;
about everything else, somewhat August fashion, in man.&#xD;
ner, but yet so cleverly that even Mrs. Derrick confessed&#xD;
afterwards she had been entertained. Now, on Faith's re-&#xD;
appearance, he went on with his subject until he cameo a&#xD;
natural pause in the conversation; which he changed by&#xD;
remarking, in a simple tone of interest,&#xD;
"I haven't learned yet satisfactorily what took Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den away ?"&#xD;
"His own business," said Mrs. Derrick. "You must&#xD;
have heard what he is about now, doctor ?"&#xD;
"I have heard -but one hears everything. It is true&#xD;
then ?"&#xD;
"0 yes, it's true," said Mrs. Derrick with an even play&#xD;
of her knitting-needles.&#xD;
"But then follows another very natural question," said&#xD;
the doctor.-" Why did he come here at all ?"&#xD;
"I dare say he'd tell you if he was here-as I wish lie&#xD;
was," said Mrs. Derrick,-" Mr. Linden always seemed to&#xD;
have good reasons for what he did."&#xD;
"I think that too," said the doctor. "I am not quite&#xD;
so sure of his telling them to me. But Pattaquasset has&#xD;
reason to be very sorry h~ is gone away! What sort of&#xD;
a preacher will he make, Mrs. Derrick ?"&#xD;
"He's a good one now-" said Mrs. Derrick with a&#xD;
smile that was even a little moved. "Don't you think so,&#xD;
doctor ?"&#xD;
"How dare you ask me that, Mrs. Derrick ?" said the&#xD;
doctor with slow funny utterance. "But I will confess&#xD;
this,-I would rather have him preach to me than you."&#xD;
"What sort of a bad reason have you got for that ~ she&#xD;
said, looking at him.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," said the doctor with the mock air of&#xD;
being in a dilemma,.-"you are good at definitions, if I&#xD;
remember - what is the proper character of a bad rea-&#xD;
Faith looked up-heJiad never seen her look prettier~&#xD;
with a little hidden Iaff~hter both on and under her face&#xD;
and that colour she had brought down stairs with her.&#xD;
But her answer was demure enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I suppose, sir, one that ought not to be a reason at all,&#xD;
.~or one that is not reason- enough."&#xD;
"Do you consider it a bad reason for my not liking Mrs.&#xD;
Perrick's preaching, that I am afraid of her ?"&#xD;
"I shouldn't think it was reason enough," said Faith.&#xD;
Do you like preaching from people that you are afraid&#xD;
of?''&#xD;
"Yes. At least I think I should. I don't know that I&#xD;
ever really was afraid of anybody."&#xD;
These words, or the manner which went with them, quite&#xD;
obliterated the idea of Mrs. Derrick from the doctor's head.&#xD;
But his manner did not change. He only addressed his&#xD;
talk to Faith and altered the character of it. Nothing&#xD;
could be more cool and disembarrassed. He had chosen&#xD;
his tactics.&#xD;
They were made to regulate likewise the length of hi~&#xD;
visit, though the short summer evening had near run its&#xD;
course before he (in parliamentary phrase) 'was on his legs'&#xD;
......not to speak but to go. Then strolling on to the front&#xD;
door, he there met Reuben Taylor; flush in the doorway.&#xD;
The boy stt~pt back into the hall to let him come out;&#xD;
whence, as the doctor saw through the open window,-lie&#xD;
went at once to Faith's side. But either accidentally or of&#xD;
design, Reuben stood so directly before her, that Dr. Har-&#xD;
rison could see neither face-indeed could scarce see her at&#xD;
all. The little business transaction that went on then-.--the&#xD;
letter which Reuben took from his pocket and then again&#xD;
from its outer envelope,-the simple respect and pleasure&#xD;
with which he gave it to Faith-though coloring a little&#xD;
too,-all this was invisible, except to Mrs. Derrick. Faith's&#xD;
face would have told the doctor the whole. The pretty&#xD;
colour-the dropped eyes-and the undertone of her grate-&#xD;
ful, "I am very much obliged to you, Reuben !" -&#xD;
Reuben made no verbal answer, and staid not a minute&#xD;
longer, but the pleasure of his new trust was wonderful!&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
1?AITH did not have as uninterrupted a time for studies&#xD;
I as she had counted upon for the next few months. ~&#xD;
the first place, letters took a great many hours. In the&#xD;
second place, her studies were pretty frequently broken up&#xD;
of an evening by Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
He certainly caine often; whether it was because of the&#xD;
strength of attraction in that particular house, or the&#xD;
failure of any attraction beside in all the coasts of Patta-&#xD;
quasset, was a problem which remained unsolved by any-&#xD;
thing in the doctor's manner. His manner was like what&#xD;
it had been the evening just recounted. He amused him-&#xD;
self, after his nonchalant fashion, and amused his hearers;&#xD;
he did not in the mean time call upon them for any help at&#xD;
all. He discerned easily that Faith had a little shyness&#xD;
about her; tha~t might mean one thing or it might mean&#xD;
another; and Dr. Harrison was far too wise to risk the&#xD;
one thing by endeavouring to find out whether it was the&#xD;
other. The doctor was no fisher-had no favour for the&#xD;
sport; but if he had been, he might have thought that now&#xD;
he was going to give his fish a very long line indeed, and&#xD;
let it play to any extent of shyness or wilfulness; his hand&#xD;
on the reel all the time. /&#xD;
The talk that would do for Miss Essie would not please&#xD;
Faith. The doctor knew that long ago. He drew upon&#xD;
his better stores. His knowledge of the earth we live on;&#xD;
his familiarity with nature's and art's wonders; histo~y~and&#xD;
philosophy; literature and science; and a knowledge of&#xD;
the world which he used as a little piquant spice to flavour&#xD;
all the rest of his knowledge. Thrown in justly, with a nice&#xD;
hand, so as not to offend, it did rather serve to provoke a&#xD;
delicate Palate; while it unmistakably gratified his own. It&#xD;
was the salt to the doctor's dish.&#xD;
(1i92)&#xD;
&#xD;
]3ut everything wants breaking up with variety, and&#xD;
variety itself may come to be monotonous. He asked&#xD;
Faith one evening if she knew anything of chemistry; and&#xD;
1i'oceeded upon her reply to give her sundry bits of detail&#xD;
and some further insight into the meaning and bearing of&#xD;
the science. It was not August then, but it might have&#xD;
been, for the leisurely manner in which the doctor 'unwound&#xD;
his skein' of talk, as~ if he were talking to himself or for&#xD;
himself; and yet he was, and he knew it, filling Faith's&#xD;
ears with delight. He took up the same subject afterwards&#xD;
from time to time; beginning from any trifle of suggestion,&#xD;
he would go off into an exquisite chemical discussion, illus-&#xD;
trated and pointed and ornamented, as no lecturer but one&#xD;
loving both his subject and his object could ever make it.&#xD;
After a while the doctor began to come with bits of metal&#xD;
and pliials of acids, and delight Faith and astonish Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick by turning her sitting-room into an impromptu&#xD;
laboratory. Such fumes! such gaseous odours! such ornin-&#xD;
ens 'reports', were never known in and about Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick's quiet household; nor were her basins and tumblers&#xD;
ever put to such strange, and iii her view hideous, uses.&#xD;
But Dr. Harrison rather seemed to enjoy what appeared at&#xD;
first sight inconveniences; triumphed overthe imperfections&#xD;
of tools and instruments, and wrought wonders over which&#xD;
Faith bent with greater raptures than if the marvels of&#xD;
Aladdin's lamp had been shewn before her. The doctor&#xD;
began by slow degrees; he let all this grow up of itself;&#xD;
he asked only for a tumbler the first time. And insensibly&#xD;
they went on, from one thing to another; till instead of a&#xD;
tumbler, the doctor would sometimes be surrounded with a&#xD;
most extraordinary retinue and train of diversified crockery&#xD;
and china. An empty butter-tub came to do duty for a&#xD;
water-bath; bottles and jars and cups and glasses, of various&#xD;
shapes' and dimensions, attended or waited upon the doc-&#xD;
tor's operations; and with a slight apology and assurance&#xD;
to Mrs. Derrick he on more than one or two occasions ap-&#xD;
propriated the clock-shade for his use and behoof as a re-&#xD;
ceiver. Then siphons began to come in the doctor's&#xD;
pocket; and glass tubes, bent and straight, open and&#xD;
scaled, in the doctor's hand; and one of his evenings came&#xD;
to be 'better than a play.' A most beautiful.and exquisite&#xD;

play to Faith. Yet Dr. Harrison never forgot his tactics;&#xD;
never let his fish feel the line; and to Faith's joyous "low&#xD;
shill I ever thank you, Dr. Harrison 1'-would reply by a&#xD;
dry request that she would induce Mrs. Derrick to have&#xD;
muffins for tea some evening and let him come.&#xD;
And what did Dr. Harrison gain by all this? lie did&#xD;
gain some hours of pleasure-that would have been very&#xD;
exquisite pleasure, but for the doubt that haunted him, and&#xD;
respecting which he could get no data of decision. The&#xD;
shyness and reserve did pass away from Faith; she met&#xD;
him and talked with him as a pleasant intimate friend&#xD;
whose company she enjoyed and who had a sort of right to&#xD;
hers; the right of friendship and kindliness. But then he&#xD;
never did anything to try her shyness or to call up her&#xD;
reserve. He never, asked anything of her that she could&#xD;
refuse. He never advanced a step where it could with de-&#xD;
cency be repressed. He knew it. But he bided his time.&#xD;
He did not know what thorough ~nd full accounts of all his&#xD;
evenings went-through the post-office.&#xD;
He knew, and it rather annoyed him, that Reuben Tay-&#xD;
lor was very freely admitted and very intimately regarded&#xD;
in the house. There was perhaps no very good reason why&#xD;
this should have annoyed the, doctor. Yet somehow he&#xD;
always rather identified Reuben Taylor with another of his&#xD;
friends. He found out, too, that Reuben much preferred&#xD;
the times when he, the doctor, was not there; for after once&#xD;
or twice coming in upon sulphuric acid and clock shades&#xD;
(from which he retreated faster than if it had all been gun-&#xD;
powder~ Reuben changed his hour; and the doctor had the&#xD;
satisfaction of wishing him good evening in the porch-os'&#xD;
of passing him on the sidewalk-or of hearing the s~;ing&#xD;
of the little gate and Reuben's quick bound up the steps&#xD;
when his own feet were well out in the common ground of&#xD;
the road.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick expressed unequivocally (to Faith, not the&#xD;
doctor) her dislike of all chemical 'smells' whatever, and her&#xD;
abhorrence of all 'reports' but those which went off after&#xD;
the doctor's departure; the preparation of which Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick beheld with a sort of vindictive satisfaction. Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den enjoyed his letters unqualifiedly, so~jnetimcs wrote&#xD;
chymical answers-now and then forestalling the doctor,&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                 19~i&#xD;
but rarely saying mudli about him. Yaith was in little&#xD;
danger of annoyance from anything with her mother sitting&#xD;
by, and for the rest Dr. liarrison was at his own risk.&#xD;
Letters were too precious-every inch of them-to be much&#xD;
taken up with discussing him. Other things were of more&#xD;
interest, - sometimes discussion, sometimes information,&#xD;
oftenest of all, talk; and now and then came with the&#xD;
letter some book to give Faith a new bit of reading.&#xD;
Above all, the letters told her-in a sort of indefinable,&#xD;
unconscious way, how much, how much her presence was&#xD;
missed and longed for; it seemed to her as if where one&#xD;
letter laid it down the next took it up-not in word but in&#xD;
atmosphere~ and carried it further. In that one respect&#xD;
(though Faith never found it out) the chemical accounts&#xD;
gave pain.&#xD;
Faith in her letters never spoke directly of this element&#xD;
of his; but she made many a gentle effort to meet it and&#xD;
soothe what could be soothed. To this end partly were her&#xD;
very full accounts of all the course of her quiet life. As&#xD;
fearlessly and simply as possible Faith talked, to him;&#xD;
quite willing to b9 found wrong arid to be told so, where-&#xD;
ever wrong was. It was rather by the fulness of what&#xD;
she gave him, than by any declaration of want on her own&#xD;
part, that Mr~ Linden could tell from her letters how much&#xD;
she felt or missed in his absence. She rarely put any of&#xD;
that into words,, and if it got in atmospherically it was by&#xD;
the subtlest of entrances. When she spoke it at all, it was&#xD;
generally a very frank and simple expression of strong&#xD;
truth.&#xD;
Of out-door work, during all this time, she had a variety.&#xD;
For some time after Mr. (Linden's going away, neither&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh nor the Squire had b~en near the&#xD;
house; but then they began to amuse th mselves with&#xD;
taking her to drive, and whenever Faith coiAd and would&#xD;
go she was sure of a pleasant hour or two out in the brisk&#xD;
autumn air, and with no danger of even hearing Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den's name mentioned. The silence indeed proved rather&#xD;
too much, but it was better than speech. Then she and&#xD;
Reuben had many excursions, short and long. Sometimes&#xD;
the flowers or eggs or tracts were sent by~ him alone, but&#xD;
often Faith chose to go too; and he was her ever ready,&#xD;

&#xD;
respectful, and efficient eseort,~-~respect it was truly, of the&#xD;
deepest and most affectionate kind. And thus-~-on foot or&#xD;
with 'Jerry-..the two went their rounds; but at such hot~ses&#xD;
Faith must both hear and speak of Mr. Linden-there was&#xD;
always some question to answer, some story to hear.&#xD;
It happened, among Dr. Harrison's other pleasures, that&#xD;
he several times met them on these expeditions; generally&#xD;
when he was driving, sometimes when they were too; but&#xD;
one late November afterno~n-not late in the month but&#xD;
late in the day, fortune favoured him. Strolling along for&#xD;
an unwanted walk, the doctor beheld from a little hill Faith&#xD;
and Reuben in the valley below,-saw them go up to the&#xD;
door of a cottage, saw Faith go in, and Rouben sit down&#xD;
in the porch and take out his book. It was a fair picture,&#xD;
-the brown woodland, the soft sunlight, the little dark&#xD;
cottage, the pretty youthful figures with their quick steps&#xD;
and natural gest~ires, and the evenin~r hue and tone of&#xD;
everything. But the doctor did not admire it-and&#xD;
went down the hill without even taking off his hat to&#xD;
the chickadees that bobbed their black caps at him from&#xD;
both sides of the road. By the porch the doctor suddenly&#xD;
slackened his pace, looked within, nodded to Reuben, and&#xD;
came to a halt.&#xD;
"Have II accidentally found out where you live7 Reu~.&#xD;
ben ?"&#xD;
"I live down by the shore, sir," said Reuben standing&#xD;
up.&#xD;
"I thought-" said the doctor, "I had got an impres-&#xD;
sion that you were not a thorough-going Pattaquasseter-..&#xD;
but you looked so much at home there.-Where do you&#xD;
live? whereabouts, I mean; for the shore stretches a long&#xD;
way."&#xD;
Reuben gave the vernacular name of the little rocky&#xD;
coast point which was his home, but the point itself was&#xD;
too much out of the doctor's 'beat' to have the name&#xD;
familiar.&#xD;
"How far off is that?"&#xD;
"About four miles from here, sir."&#xD;
"May I ask what you are studying so dilig9utly fout'&#xD;
miles from home at this hour ~&#xD;
Reuben coloured a good deal, but with not more than a&#xD;
&#xD;
moment's reluctance held out his book for the doctor's&#xD;
inspection, it was a Bible. rI~he doctor's face changed.&#xD;
ever so little; but with what feeling, or combination of&#xD;
feelings, it would have taken a much wiser reader of men&#xD;
and faces than Reuben to tell. It was only a moment, and&#xD;
then he stood ~vith the book in his hand gravely turning it&#xD;
over, but with his usual face.&#xD;
"I once had the pleasure of asking you questions on&#xD;
some other matters," he remarked, - "and I remember&#xD;
you answered well. Can you pass as good an examination&#xD;
in this ?"&#xD;
"As to the words, sir? or the thoughts ? -J don't quite&#xD;
know," said Reuben modestly.&#xD;
"Words are the signs of thoughts, you know."&#xD;
"Yes, sir-but nobody can know all the Bible thoughts-&#xD;
though some people have learned all the Bible words."&#xD;
The doctor gave a little sort of commenting nod, rather&#xD;
approving than otherwise. "You are safe here," he said&#xD;
as he handed the book back to Reuben; "for in this study&#xD;
I couldn't examine you. What arc you pursuing the study&#xD;
for ?-may I ask ?"&#xD;
"If you don't know I" was ~he boy's full gaze for a,&#xD;
moment. But he looked down ~gain, answering steadily-&#xD;
"'Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin&#xD;
against thee !'-I love it, Dr. harrison-and it shows me&#xD;
the way to serve God."&#xD;
"Well," said the doctor rather kindly- "if I hadn't&#xD;
interrupted you, how much more study would you have&#xD;
accomplished before you thought it time to set off for&#xD;
that four miles' walk home -to that unpronounceable&#xD;
place?"&#xD;
"I don't know, sir-I am not obliged to be there by any&#xD;
particular time of night."&#xD;
"No, I know you are not. But-excuse my curiosity!&#xD;
~are you so fond of the Bible that you stop on the waj&#xD;
home to read it as you go alono'?&#xD;
somebody ?"                  * or are you waiting' for&#xD;
The words brought the colour back with a different tinge,&#xD;
but Reuben simply answered, "No, sir-I did not stop here&#xD;
to read. I am waiting."&#xD;
"For Miss Derrick, are you not ?"&#xD;

"Then I dare say Miss Derrick will release you for this&#xD;
time, and allow me to attend her home, whither I am going&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
"I must wait till she comes out, sir," Reuben said,&#xD;
with the respectful intractability which the doctor remem~&#xD;
bered.&#xD;
"Of course 1" he said. "Did you ever take lessons of&#xD;
anybody but Mr. Linden ?-" But at this point the house&#xD;
door opened and Faith came out.&#xD;
"Miss Faith" said the doctor, after his greeting which&#xD;
was thoroughly in character, "if you will tell your escort&#xD;
here-who I am sure is a staunch one-.that you need him&#xD;
no longer, he will feel free to begin his long walk to the&#xD;
shore,-and I shall have the rare pleasure and honour of&#xD;
going home with you. "&#xD;
Faith turned frankly. "Do you want to go home,&#xD;
Reuben ?"&#xD;
"No, Miss Faith"~was the equally frank, low-spoken&#xD;
answer,-"not unless you want me to go." Reuben could&#xD;
but speak the truth-and he did try to speak it with as&#xD;
little offence as possible; though with an instinctive feeling&#xD;
that the time 'when truth will be truth and not treason',&#xD;
had not y~t arrived. "I mean, that I want to do just what&#xD;
you wish," he added looking up at her.&#xD;
"I don't want you to go, then," said Faith laughing,&#xD;
"for I mean that you shall come home to tea with me.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison, I will invite you too," she said turning her&#xD;
bright face towards him. "I believe-there are muffins&#xD;
to-night."&#xD;
"Miss Faith,"-said the doctor,-" you are an angel !"&#xD;
"What is the connexion between that and muffins ?"&#xD;
said Faith merrily, for Reuben was at her side and she felt&#xD;
free.&#xD;
"You mistake the connexion," said the doctor gravely.&#xD;
"Angels are supposed to be impartial in their attentions to&#xD;
the human race, and not swayed by such curious-and of&#xD;
course arrogant-considerations as move the lower herd of&#xD;
mortals. To an immaterial creature, how can the height&#xD;
of a door be material 1"&#xD;
"But I think you are mistaken," said Faith gently. "1&#xD;
&#xD;
don't believe any creatures mind more what they find inside&#xD;
the door."&#xD;
"What did you find inside that door ?" said the doc-&#xD;
tor.&#xD;
Faith hesitiited. "Do you know to-morrow is Thanks-&#xD;
giving day, Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
"I am not quite sure that I ought to say I know it-&#xD;
though my father did read the proclamation. I suppose I&#xD;
know it now."&#xD;
"I found inside of that door some people who could not&#xD;
make pumpkin pies-and Reuben and I have been carry~&#xD;
ing them one of mother's."&#xD;
"What a day they will have of it !" said the doctor,-&#xD;
"if Mrs. Derrick's pies are made in the same place as her&#xD;
muffins. But can you find nothing better to do than run-&#xD;
ning round the country to supply the people that haven't&#xD;
pies ?"&#xD;
"Not many things pleasanter," said Faith looking at&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"I see I was right," said he smiling. "I have no doubt&#xD;
angels do that sort of thitig. But it is a sort of pleasure&#xD;
of which I have no knowledge. All my life I have pleased&#xD;
only myself. Yet one would wish to have some share in it,&#xD;
too. I can't make pies! And if I could, I shouldn't know&#xD;
in the least where to bestow them. Do you think you could&#xD;
take this now," said he producing a gold eagle, "and turn&#xD;
it into pumpkins or anything else that you think will make&#xD;
people happy-and see that they get to the right places?&#xD;
-for me&#xD;
"Do you mean it seriously, Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
"If you will have the condescension I"&#xD;
"Oh thank you !" said Faith flushing with joy,-" oh&#xD;
thank you! I am very glad of this, and so will many&#xD;
others he. Dr. HarrisOn, I wish you could know the plea-&#xD;
sure this will give !.-..the good it will do."&#xD;
"I don't think a ten-dollar piece ever gave me so. much&#xD;
pleasure," said he looking a little moved. "About the&#xD;
good I don't know; that's not so easy."&#xD;
Faith left that point for him to consider, though with&#xD;
many a wish in her own heart. But the walk home bright~&#xD;
en~d into a very lleasaut one after that.&#xD;

CHAPTER xv.&#xD;
T HE soft grey clouds which had hung about the setting&#xD;
sun only waited his departure to double their folds&#xD;
and spread them all over the sky. Then the wind rose,&#xD;
svieepiug gustily through the bare branches, and heavy&#xD;
drops of rain fell scatteringly on the dead leaves, But&#xD;
when wind and rain had taken a little more counsel to-&#xD;
gether, they joined forces in a wild stormy concert which&#xD;
swept on with increasing tumult. It did not disturb Faith&#xD;
and her mother, at their quiet work and rcading,-it did&#xD;
not deter Cindy from going over night to spend Thanks-&#xD;
giving day with her friends,-but it was a wild storm&#xD;
nevertheless; and while the hours of the night rolled on&#xD;
over the sleepers in Mrs. Derrick's house, still wind and&#xD;
rain kept up their carousal, mior thought of being quiet&#xD;
even when the morning broke.&#xD;
"But rather, giving of thanks."-.That was the motto of&#xD;
the day-the one answer to the many vexed questions of&#xD;
life and care. Care was pressing, and life distracting, and&#xD;
everywhere was something that seemed to call for tears or&#xD;
complaints. To all of these the day answered-"But&#xD;
rather, giving of thanks."&#xD;
was dark enough when Faith awoke; and she sat up&#xD;
in bed a minute or two, listening to'the wild blasts of wind&#xD;
and the heavy pattering of the rain,-hearing the screech&#xD;
of the locomotive as the train swept by in the distance,&#xD;
with a pang at the thought of its freight of homeward-&#xD;
bound and expected dear ones,-4hen taking the day's&#xD;
motto, and gently and quietly going about the day's work.&#xD;
But the first of its work for her, was to cancel the bit of&#xD;
work it had already done by itself; and for that Faith&#xD;
went to her Bible,-went first to the list of texts that had&#xD;
come with it; endeavouring to realize and make sure her&#xD;
ground on that verse of the 91st Psalm-then on from&#xD;
that to its following.-~-.&#xD;
(200)&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.201&#xD;
"For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his&#xD;
pavilion."&#xD;
It was not a "time of trouble." Faith would not call it&#xD;
so. Never so bright a Thanksgiving day had risen upon&#xD;
her, spite of its clouds. But trouble might come; in the&#xD;
course of life-experience she knew it was pretty sure to&#xD;
come; and she sought to refuge herself beforehand in the&#xD;
promise of that pavilion of hiding. The driving wind and&#xD;
storm that emblematized another kind, gave emphasis also&#xD;
to the emblem of shelter. how Faith blessed her Bible!&#xD;
The next verse enlarged a little.-.&#xD;
"Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence&#xD;
from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a&#xD;
paviLion from the strife of tongues."&#xD;
Then followed the joyful acceptance of that promise-.&#xD;
"Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me&#xD;
from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of&#xD;
deliverance."&#xD;
Then its result.-..&#xD;
"I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I&#xD;
trust in the mercy of God for ever and ever."&#xD;
"From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when&#xD;
my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is&#xD;
higher than I. For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a&#xD;
strong tower from the enemy. I will abide in thy taber-&#xD;
nacle for ever; I will trust in the covert of thy wings."&#xD;
What strong refuge! what riches of trust !-iow very&#xD;
bright Faith's fire-lit room looked, with the wind whistling&#xD;
all about, and the red light on her open Bible. She turned&#xD;
on. And like the full burst of a chorus after that solo, she&#xD;
seemed to hear the whole Church Militant say,-.&#xD;
"Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place in all genera.&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
11cr mind 'swept back to the martyr' ages,~to times when&#xD;
the church's road has been in darkness and in light, and the&#xD;
long train of pilgrims have gone over it in light and in&#xD;
darkness, each with that staff in his hand. Faith looked&#xD;
long at those words, seeming to see the great "cloud of wit-&#xD;
flesses" pass in procession before her. How true the words&#xD;
were to Abraham, when he lcft his home. How true to&#xD;
Daniel when he was thrown to the lions. How true they&#xD;

&#xD;
were to Stephen when he uttered his dying cry !~-how true&#xD;
to the little child whom she had seen go to be with Christ&#xD;
for ever 1.-" In all generations."&#xD;
The prophets, true to their office, threw the light for-&#xD;
ward.-&#xD;
"He shall be for a sanctuary."&#xD;
"Although I have cast them far off among the heathen,&#xD;
and although I have scattered them among the countries,&#xD;
yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries&#xD;
where they shall come."&#xD;
"I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the&#xD;
lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon. his branches&#xD;
shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and&#xD;
his smell as Lebanon."&#xD;
The next words gave the whole description, the whole&#xD;
key of entrance.&#xD;
"Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God,&#xD;
God dwelleth in him and he in God. And we have knowii&#xD;
and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love;&#xD;
and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Here was the "Sanctuary" on earth,-the foreshowing&#xD;
image of the one on high.&#xD;
"I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty&#xD;
and the Lamb are the temple of it."&#xD;
How far Faith had got from the earthly Thanksgiving&#xD;
day~even to that finished and everlasting one on high!&#xD;
She had of course read and studied these passages all be-&#xD;
fore-once; and then she had shut them up as a particular&#xD;
casket of treasures that she would not grow too familiar&#xD;
with suddenly, but would keep to enjoy their brightness&#xD;
another time. Something this Thanksgiving morning had&#xD;
made Faith want them. She now sat looking at the last&#xD;
words, feeling as if she wanted nothing.&#xD;
The wind and the rain still raged without, drowning and&#xD;
merging any sounds there might l~e in the road, though&#xD;
truly few animate things were abroad at that hour in that&#xD;
weather. Mr. Skip had roused himself, indeed, for his&#xD;
day's pleasure7 and after lighting the kitchen fire had gone&#xD;
forth-.leaving it to take care of itself; but when the door&#xD;
closed after him, Faith and her fire looked at each other in&#xD;
&#xD;
the same stillness as before. Until she heard the front&#xD;
door open aiid shut,.-that was the first sound, and the&#xD;
last,-no unwanted one, either; that door opened and shut&#xD;
twenty times a day. What intangible, well-recognized&#xD;
modification in its motions now, made ~Faith's heart bound&#xD;
and sink with sudden belief-with swift denial? MTho was&#xD;
it? at that hour! Faith sprang to the parlour door, she&#xD;
did not know how, and was in the dark hall. A little&#xD;
gleam of firelight followed her-a little faint dawn came&#xD;
through the fanlight of the door: just enough to reveal to&#xD;
Faith those very outlines which at first sight she had pro-&#xD;
nounced "pleasant." One more spring Faith made; with&#xD;
no scream of delight, but with a low exclamation, very&#xD;
low, that for its many-folded sweetness was like the invo~&#xD;
lotions of a rosebud.&#xD;
"Faith !" he exclaimed. "Don't touch me till I get&#xD;
out of the rain !"-.-.which prohibition Faith mi~ht consider&#xD;
useless, or might think that-shuttlecock fashion-it had&#xD;
got turned round in the air. /&#xD;
"The best place to get out of the rain is in here," she&#xD;
said trying to draw him along with her. "Oh Endy! how&#xD;
came you in it?"&#xD;
"If you say three words to me, I shall give you the&#xD;
benefit of all the remaining raindrops," said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
disengaging himself to throw off his overcoat,-" how can&#xD;
one do anything, with you standing there? How came ill&#xD;
in it ?-.why I came in it! Precious child! how do you&#xD;
do ?" And she was taken possession Qf, and carried off&#xD;
into the next room, like a rosebud as she was, to have the&#xD;
same question put a great many times in a different way.&#xD;
More words for her, just then, Mr. Linden did not seem to&#xD;
1iave~ 1 ~or Faith for him. She stood very still, her face&#xD;
in a glow of shy joy, but her eyes and even her lips grave&#xD;
and quiet; except when sometimes a very tiny indicator&#xD;
smile broke half way upon them.&#xD;
"When did you come ?"&#xD;
"I came in the night train. Mignonette-are you glad&#xD;
to see me&#xD;
The smile showed her teeth a little. They would bear&#xD;
showing, but this was only a glimmer of the white enamel.&#xD;
"Then you have been travelling all night ?"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"Yes. How are you going to prove your position ?"&#xD;
"What position, Endy ?"&#xD;
"That you are glad to see me."&#xD;
"1 don't know,"-.-she said looking up at him.&#xD;
"You cannot think of any proof to give me ?"&#xD;
"I can think of a great many."&#xD;
"1 am ready to take them !" said Mr. Linden demurely.&#xD;
"Then if you will sit down and let me leave you for a&#xD;
few minutes, I will see what I can do."&#xD;
" Thank you-the proofs that I mean would by no means&#xD;
take you further offi Suppose you see what you can do&#xD;
without going away."&#xD;
She laid her head down for a minute, coloring too, even&#xD;
the cheek that was high-coloured before ;~but she looked up&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"Stoop your high head, then, Endy !"-she said ;~and&#xD;
she gave him two kisses, as full and earnest as they were&#xD;
soft. There was no doubt Faith had proved her~position!&#xD;
"Faith, darling," he said, "have you beeii growing thin?&#xD;
.-or is it only that I have had to do with such substantial&#xD;
humanity of late. Look up here and let me see-are you&#xD;
anything but the essence of Mignonette ?"&#xD;
The face she showed was aptly named; about as pure as&#xD;
that. With grave, loving intentness-not the less grave&#xD;
for its little companion smile.-Mr. Linden studied her face&#xD;
for a minute,-pushing back her hair.&#xD;
"Do you think,"-she said then in a light soft tone-a&#xD;
departure from the last words,-..."do you think you won't&#xD;
want the essence of something else by and by, Endecoft ?"&#xD;
"No,"-decidedly,-.-" IL want nothing but you--so you&#xD;
may as well make up your mind to want nothing but me."&#xD;
"Do you know what that would end in ?"&#xD;
"Not necessarily in such a simple duet," said Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den smiling,-" people do not always realize their ideal.&#xD;
Mignonette, you are just as lovely as you can be !--.--and&#xD;
yOu need not bring Miss Reason to keep me in order. I&#xD;
suppose if she were in the house it would end in her want-&#xD;
ing her breakfast."&#xD;
"I don't like Miss Reason," said Faith, "and the only&#xD;
thing I am thinking of putting in order is the kitchen&#xD;
fire. Would you like to go there with me? *Nobody'~ in&#xD;
&#xD;
the house-Cindy went yesterday to a wedding, and Mr.&#xD;
Skip is gone home to keep Thanksgiving."&#xD;
"That is the best thing I ever heard of Cindy," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "Of course I will go !-and play Ferdinand&#xD;
again. Faith, would the doctor call me an 'acid '-come&#xD;
to dissolve all his crystals ?"&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison gave me ten dollars yesterday for the&#xD;
poor people," said Faith as she led the way to the kitchen.&#xD;
Arrived there, she placed a chair for. Mr. Lin~len and re-&#xD;
quested him to be seated; while she examined into the&#xD;
state of the fire. The chair was disregarded-the fire&#xD;
received double attention.&#xD;
"Faith," he said laughingly, "I bear the curb about as&#xD;
well as Stranger. I have a great mind to tell you how that&#xD;
eagle stands in the doctor's memorandum book !"&#xD;
Faith dropped her hands for the moment and looked at&#xD;
him, with grave eyes of wide-open attention. The look&#xD;
changed Mr. Linden's purpose,.-he could not bear to take&#xD;
away all the pleasure the eagle had brought on his gold&#xD;
wings.&#xD;
"I don't believe there is such a book in existence;" he&#xD;
said lightly. "Miranda, what would you like to have me&#xD;
do for you now ?-the fire is ready for anything."&#xD;
"I haven't anything ready for it yet," said Faith, "but&#xD;
I will have-if you'll wait a bit. "-She left him there, and&#xD;
ran off-coming back in a little while. And then Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den was initiated, if he never was before, in kitchen myste-&#xD;
ries. Faith covered herself with great apron, rolled up&#xD;
her sleeves above the elbows, and ~vith ft~mnny little glances&#xD;
at him between~ whiles, went round 'the room about various&#xD;
pieces of work. Almost noiselessly, with the utmost nicety&#xD;
of quick and clean work, she was busy in one thing after&#xD;
another and in two or three at the same time; while Mr.&#xD;
Linden stood or sat by the fire looking on. Two things he&#xD;
comprehended; the potatoes which were put over the fire&#xD;
to boil and the white shortcakes which finally stood cut out&#xD;
on the board ready for baking. The preliminary flour and&#xD;
cream and mixing in the bowl had been (culinary) Sanserit&#xD;
to him. He had watched her somewhat silently of late,&#xD;
but none the less intently: indeed in all his watching there&#xD;
had been a silent thread woven in with its laughing and&#xD;

busy talk,-his eyes had followed her as one follows avon.&#xD;
table sunbeam,.-noting the bright gleams of colour here,&#xD;
and the soft light there, and thinking of the time when it&#xD;
must quit the room.&#xD;
"Faith," he said as sl~e cut out her cakes, "are these&#xD;
what you made for me the first night I came here ?"&#xD;
"I believe so&#xD;
"What. do you suppose you look like-going about the&#xD;
kitchen in this style ?-.you make me think irresistibly of&#xD;
something."&#xD;
"I should like to know," said Faith with an afl1used&#xD;
laugh.&#xD;
"I shall make you blush, if I tell you," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
That was enough to do it! Faith gave him one look,&#xD;
and went on with her shortcakes.&#xD;
"You don't care about knowing, after all ~ said IMr.&#xD;
Linden. "Well.-Faith, do you expect ever to make such&#xD;
things in my house ?-because if you do, I think it will&#xD;
ensure my coming down stairs before breakfast."&#xD;
How she flushed 1-over cheek and brow,-then remarked&#xD;
gravely that "she was glad he liked it."&#xD;
"Yes, and you have no idea what effects my liking will&#xD;
produce 1" said Mr. Linden. "You see, Faith, it may hap-&#xD;
pen to us now and then to be. left without other hands than&#xD;
our own in the house (there is no reliance whatever to be&#xD;
placed upon cottages!) and then you will come down, as&#xD;
now, and I shall come too-taking the precaution to bring&#xD;
a book, that nobody may suspect what I come for. Then&#xD;
enter one of my parishioners Faith, are you attend-&#xD;
ing?"&#xD;
Faith had stopped, and poising her rolling pin the re-&#xD;
verse way on the board-that is, on end,-had leaned her&#xD;
arms upon it,-giving up shortcakes entirely for the time&#xD;
being.&#xD;
"You will not be in that position," said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
"but going on properly with your cakes-as you should be&#xD;
now. Then enter one of my parishioners who lives six&#xD;
miles off, to ask me to come over to his house and instruct&#xD;
him in the best way of hanging his gate,.-which I of course&#xD;
promise to do, notwithstanding your protestations that I&#xD;
know nothing of that-nor of anything else. Parishioner&#xD;

economical we are !-.to make one fire do our cooking and&#xD;
studying. Another part have their suspicions that you&#xD;
keep me at hand to lift off the teakettle (much strength-&#xD;
ened by report of your protest.) And the charitable part&#xD;
at once propose to raise my salary-.-so that we may have&#xD;
as many fires as we like. Faith-what should we do in the&#xD;
circumstances ?"&#xD;
Faith was biting her lips and rolling out cakes with the&#xD;
swiftest activity, not allowing Mr. Linden a sight of her&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"If you hung the gate, I should think you would take&#xD;
the money "-she answered demurely.&#xD;
"I said you would say I could not do it !" said Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den. "Which being duly reported and considered by cer-&#xD;
tain other people, will cause them to shake their heads, and&#xD;
wish in half audible (but most telegraphic!) whispers, 'that&#xD;
Mr. Linden were half as smart as his wife' I"&#xD;
Faith stopped again. "Oh Endy !"-slie exclaimed be-&#xD;
tween laughing and pleading.&#xD;
"Que voulez-vous, Mademoiselle ?"&#xD;
But Faith went at her cakes and finished the few that&#xD;
were left.&#xD;
"I think you must be very much in want of your break-&#xD;
fast," she said coming to the fire. "You have played&#xD;
Prince Ferdinand-do you think you would mind acting&#xD;
the part of King Alfred, for once ?"&#xD;
"My dear, I will play any part for you whatever !-in&#xD;
our duet. Shall I practise taking off the kettle to begin&#xD;
~rith ?"&#xD;
"I don't think you had better,"-Faith said with a kept&#xD;
down laugh,-" for it doesn't boil."&#xD;
"Shall I take you off then? What are you going to do&#xD;
while I play Alfred ?-I will not answer for my solo per-&#xD;
form ances."&#xD;
"I shall not be gone but a few minutes. Do you think&#xD;
you could take this little skillet from the fire if it did&#xD;

danger of "boiling over" when Faith appeared at his side&#xD;
and with a laughing look at him gently lifted it off~&#xD;
"You are an excellent Alfred !"&#xD;
"What version of Alfred have you learned?" he said&#xD;
laughing, and catchh~g it from her hand before it reached&#xD;
the hearth. "I thought hot water was his reward-..not&#xD;
his work."&#xD;
"J thought, Endy, you would like to go up to your roon~&#xD;
before breakfast. Mother will be down presently."&#xD;
"And am I to find the perfection of a fire, as usual?"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden, taking both her hands in his and looking&#xD;
at her. "Little Sunbeam !-you should not have done&#xD;
that! Do you know what you deserve ?"&#xD;
She stood before him rather soberly, glancing up and&#xD;
down; but he little guessed what her quietness covered.&#xD;
Though the lines of her lip did give tiny indication that&#xD;
quietness was stirred somewhere. He drew her. to him for&#xD;
a moment, with one or two unconnected words of deep&#xD;
affection, then turned and went away. Faith listened to&#xD;
hear the well known run up the stairs-the familiar closing&#xD;
of that door,-.-how strange it sounded! how gladsome,&#xD;
how sorrowful. She stood still just where Mr. Linden had&#xD;
left her, as if sorrow and joy both held her with detaining&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
"Why child? Faith !"-said Mrs. Derrick coming into&#xD;
the kitchen, "what are you about? What made you get&#xD;
up so early, Faith? What's the matter ?-breakfast ready&#xD;
at this time of day! Couldn't you sleep, pretty child ?"&#xD;
she added tenderly.&#xD;
"I didn't get up very much earlier thaii usual, mother.&#xD;
Don't you want breakfast ?"&#xD;
"Whenever you like, child," said her mother, taking hold&#xD;
in her turn,-" but what's made you in such a hurry? And&#xD;
what makes you look so, Faith ?~-.---You're not pale, neither,&#xD;
.-how do you look ?"&#xD;
F~iith came so close that her mother could not see, and&#xD;
kissed her. "Mother, Mr. Linden is here."&#xD;
"Here !" said Mrs. Derrick with a little sympathetic&#xD;
start-it was not all surprise, nor all joy.-." Pretty child!&#xD;
how glad I am! But why didn't you call rue, Faith ?-and&#xD;
why don't you go and sit down and be quiet-now you've&#xD;
&#xD;
jrrst been tiring yourself, and I could have done the whole!&#xD;
And of all things, how could he get here in such weather ?&#xD;
No wonder you're in a hurry, child !"-and Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
began to work in earnest.&#xD;
Faith gave her the word or two more that sh~ could&#xD;
give, and went to the dairy. It was Faith's domain* she&#xD;
was alone, and heri~dustry fell from her hands. Breakfast&#xD;
~nd all might wait. Faith set down her bowl and spoon,&#xD;
sat down herself on the low dairy shelf before the window,&#xD;
cold and November though it was, and let the tears come,&#xD;
of which she had a whole heartful in store; and for a little&#xD;
while they fell faster than the raindrops which beat and&#xD;
rattled against the panes. But this was a gentler shower,&#xD;
and cleared the sky. Faith rose up from the shelf entirely&#xD;
herself again.&#xD;
So busy, skimming off the smooth cream, she felt the&#xD;
light touch of hands on her shoulders-felt more t~an that&#xD;
on her cheek. Had the tears left any trace there ?-that&#xD;
Mr. Linden brought her face round into view. He asked&#xD;
no such question, however, unless with his eyes.&#xD;
"Miguonette, what are you about ?"&#xD;
"King Alfred's breakfast. I forgot you knew the way&#xD;
to the dairy!"&#xD;
"Or could find it if I did not. What shape does my&#xD;
breakfast take in these regions ?"&#xD;
"It takes the shape-Let us go back to the kitchen and&#xD;
we will see."&#xD;
It was spry work in the kitchen now! How Faith's&#xD;
fingers went about. But Mr. Linden could make nothing&#xD;
~f the form his breakfast was taking-nothing of Faith's&#xD;
mysterious bowl, in which the cream he had seen her skim&#xD;
went into compound with the potatoes he had seen boiling&#xD;
and with also certain butter and eggs. The mixture went&#xD;
into the oven, and then Faith went off to set the table in&#xD;
the parlour. As they were alone to-day the fire in the&#xD;
dining-room was not to be kindled.&#xD;
The storm beat so differently upon the windows now !-.&#xD;
now, when it was only a barrier against people who were&#xD;
not wanted to come in. Mr. Linden followed Faith in her&#xD;
motions, sometimes with eye and voice, sometimes with his&#xD;
own steps; confusing both her and her arrangements,&#xD;

making her laugh, and himself the cause of various irregu.&#xD;
rarities in the table-setting, which he was very quick to&#xD;
point out.&#xD;
"Mignonette," he said, "I think it is a perfect day! Do&#xD;
you hear how it storms ?"&#xD;
"And aren't you glad Cindy went to a wedding? And&#xD;
oh, Endy !-.how many people will be coming after you&#xD;
to-day ?" Faith stopped, knife in hand.&#xD;
"Did you suppose that I would come here to see you,&#xD;
and then be obliged to see half Pattaquasset instead? I&#xD;
stopped at Patchaug stati6n,.-there Reuben met me, and&#xD;
we had as pleasant a four mile drive in the rain as I ever&#xD;
remember. As to the wedding-I think there can never&#xD;
be more than one other so felicitous."&#xD;
Faith ran off.&#xD;
And presently the breakfast came in, variously, in her&#xD;
hands and in Mrs. Derrick's. It was broad light now, and&#xD;
the curtains drawn back, but the red firelight still gave the&#xD;
hue of the room; and the breakfast-table and the three&#xD;
people round it wanted for no element or means of com-&#xD;
fort. There were the shortcakes, which Mr. Linden might&#xD;
more readily i'ecognize now in their light brown flakiness-&#xD;
his coffee was poured upon the richest of cream; the pota.&#xD;
toes came out of the oven in the shape of a great puff-hall,&#xD;
of most tender consistency; and the remains of a cold&#xD;
chicken had been mystified into such a dish of delicacy as&#xD;
no hands but a Frenchwoman's-or Faith's-.-could con-&#xD;
coct. It's a pleasant thing to be catered for by hands that&#xD;
love you. Mr. Linden had found that pleasure this morn-&#xD;
ing before. But both Faith and he were undoubtedly&#xD;
ready for their breakfast!&#xD;
After breakfast came the consideration of a basketful of&#xD;
things Mr. Linden had brought her. Very simple things&#xD;
they were, and unromantic enough to be useful; yet with&#xD;
sentiment enough about them, - if that name might be&#xD;
given to the tokens of a care that busied itself about all&#xD;
the ins and outs of her daily life, and sought out and&#xD;
remembered the various little things that she wanted and&#xD;
could not get; for the various papers of sugarpluins in&#xD;
which the whole were packed, Mr. Linden declared them&#xD;
to be nothing but epithets and adjectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
The weather held On its way into the afternoon; but&#xD;
what was most unexpected, the afternoon brought a visitor.&#xD;
Mr. Linden and Faith, deep in talk, heard the sound of&#xD;
a foot on the scraper and then of a knock at the door,&#xD;
~hj~h made them both start up. Faith went to the door.&#xD;
J3ut before she could open it, Mrs. Derrick came up behind&#xD;
her with swift steps and remanded Faith to the parlour.&#xD;
"I'll open it, child," she said,-"it's no use for you to&#xD;
run the risk of seeing anybody you don't want to." So&#xD;
Faith returned to Mr. Linden. But the first word set all&#xD;
fears at rest-it was only Reuben Taylor. He presented&#xD;
himself with many apologies, and would fain have told his&#xD;
errand to Mrs. Derrick, but as it was for Faith, the good&#xD;
lady opened the parlour door and bade Reuben go in,----&#xD;
which, as. he could not* help it, Reuben did. But the&#xD;
colour of his face as he came in !-Mr. Linden took the&#xD;
effect of it-Faith was partly occupied with her own; and&#xD;
Reuben, thinking the sooner the quicker--walked straight&#xD;
up to her.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he said, trying to' speak as usual, "I beg&#xD;
your pardon-but I was sent here with this,"-a~nd Reuben&#xD;
presented a moderately large round basket, without a handle.&#xD;
"Reuben, come up to the fire," said Mr. Linden; while&#xD;
Faith took the basket and exclaimed, "This! Who in the&#xD;
world sent you, Reuben ?-.--Yes, come to the fire."&#xD;
"I am not cold, sir," Reuben said with a look towards&#xD;
where Mr. Linden stood by the mantelpiece, as if his desire&#xD;
was to get out of the room-instead of further in, though&#xD;
he did follow Faith a step or two as she went that way. "I&#xD;
didn't mean to come here to-day, Mr. Linden, but-"&#xD;
"Didn't mean to come here ?" said Mr. Linden smiling,&#xD;
.-" what have you been doing, to be afraid of me? Faith,&#xD;
has your postman been remiss ?"&#xD;
They were a pair, Reuben and Faith! though the*colour&#xD;
of the one was varying, while Reuben's was steady. Faith&#xD;
nevertheless seized the boy's hand and drew him with gentle&#xD;
violence up to the fire.&#xD;
"Who sent you with this, Reuben ?"&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison, Miss Faith. I was off on an errand after&#xD;
church, and one of his men came after me and told me to&#xD;
come to the house. And there I saw the doctor~piimsclf-&#xD;

&#xD;
and he told me to bring you this basket, ma'am, and that&#xD;
he didn't like to trust it to any one else. And-" but there&#xD;
Reuben hesitated.&#xD;
"And that you were the only person he knew w 0 would&#xD;
go through fire and water for him ?" said Mr. Li den.&#xD;
"No, sir, but-I suppose I've got to say it, since he told&#xD;
me to,-Dr. Harrison said, Miss Faith, that-" the message&#xD;
seemed to stir both Reuben's shame and laughter-" that&#xD;
he had begged a cake of his sister, to go with your Thanks.&#xD;
giving pies - and that it was in the basket. And that I&#xD;
needn't tell anybody else about it."&#xD;
"Reuben," said Mr. Linden laughing, "you needn't tell&#xD;
him that I shall eat half the cake."&#xD;
"No, sir"-Reuben said, - and tried not to laugh, and&#xD;
couldn't help it.&#xD;
The third member of the trio showed no disposition at&#xD;
all to mueh laughter. She had put the basket down on the&#xD;
table and looked at it from a distance, as if it had contained&#xD;
the four and twenty live blackbirds - or a small powder&#xD;
magazine. The effect of his message Reuben did not stay&#xD;
to see. He went round to Mr. Linden to ask if the morn-&#xD;
ing orders were unchanged, clasped hands with him-then&#xD;
bowed low to* Faith and went out.&#xD;
With very demure face Mr. Linden seated himself in one&#xD;
of the easy-chairs, and looked towards the table, with the&#xD;
aii~ of ~ne who expects - something! And not demurely&#xD;
but with grave consciousness, Faith stood looking in the&#xD;
same direction; then her eyes went to Mr. Linden. But&#xD;
his face did not relax in the least.&#xD;
"Do you suppose that basket holds a kitt~ii ?" he said&#xD;
contemplatively.&#xD;
Faith did not answer but walked over to the table and&#xD;
began the work of investigation. Mr. Linden came too.&#xD;
- "if you are to make feline discoveries, I must stand by&#xD;
you, little bird," he said.&#xD;
The basket was carefully tied with a network of strings&#xD;
over the top; then followed one paper after another, a silk&#xD;
paper at last,-and the cake was revealed. The low excla-&#xD;
mation that burst from Faith might be characterized as one&#xD;
of mingled admiration and dismay.&#xD;
Certainly Dr. Harrison had amused himself that Thanks*&#xD;
&#xD;
giving day! perhaps in terror of his old enemy, ennui. At&#xD;
least his basket looked so.&#xD;
The cake lay upon a white paper in the basket, with a&#xD;
little space all around. It was a rather small loaf with a&#xD;
plain icing. But round the sides of it were trailed long&#xD;
sprays of ivy geranium, making a beautiful bordering. The&#xD;
centre was crowned with a white camellia in its perfection.&#xD;
From the tip edge of each outer petal depended a drop of&#xD;
gold, made to adhere there by some strong gum probably;&#xD;
and between the camellia and the ivy wreaths was a brilliant&#xD;
ring of gold spots, somewhat larger, set in the icing. Some-&#xD;
body, and it was probably the doctor, for want of better to&#xD;
do,-liad carefully prepared the places to receive them, so&#xD;
that they were set in the white like a very neat inlay. It&#xD;
was presently seen that quarter eagles made the inlay, and&#xD;
that the camellia was dropped with gold dollars.&#xD;
On the ivy lay a note. Faith looked at Mr. Linden as&#xD;
she took it up; broke the seal, and hastily running over the&#xD;
paper gave it to him-&#xD;
"Mv DEA1~ Miss FAITH,&#xD;
My yesterday's speculation in pumpkins proved so suc-&#xD;
cessful, that like a true speculator it made me want to&#xD;
plunge deeper - into the pumpkin field! Ii find myself&#xD;
this morning dissatisfied with xvhat I have done-and beg&#xD;
to send a cake to go along with the pies-to be appor-&#xD;
tioned of course as your judgment shall suggest. I begged&#xD;
the cake from Sophy, who 1 am sure would not have given&#xD;
it to me if she had known what I was going to do with it.&#xD;
Your pleasure, personal and representative, last night,&#xD;
is a reproach to me whenever I think of it. Yet my un-&#xD;
wonted hand knows neither how to cut up cake, nor what&#xD;
to do with it when it is cut-except.---avaler! Am I wrong&#xD;
in hoping that you will do me the grace to make available&#xD;
what I should only-if I tried to do better with it-.--throw&#xD;
away? and that as a token of your forgiveness and grace&#xD;
you will on the next opportunity bestow a piece of pump-&#xD;
kin pie, such as you carried the other night, on&#xD;
Your very respectful and most obedient servant,&#xD;
PATTAQUASSET, Nov. 16, 18-..     JULIUS HARRISON."&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. Linden read the note more deliberately than Fai$j&#xD;
had done, but his face, the while, she could not read;&#xD;
though (fa~inated by the difficulty) her glances changed&#xD;
to a steady gaze. It was quietly grave -that was all and&#xD;
not all,-and the note was giv~n back to her with a smile&#xD;
that spoke both 'thoughts' of the doctor, and pleasure for&#xD;
any pleasure Faith might have from his basket. But thezi&#xD;
some of the deeper feeling came out in his comments.......and&#xD;
they were peculiar. He had stood still for a second after&#xD;
reading the note, -his eyes looking down at the cake.....&#xD;
gravely; but then they came to her;~ and suddenly taking&#xD;
her in his arms Mr. Linden gave her-it would be hazard.&#xD;
ous to say, as many kisses as Dr. Harrison had gold pieces&#xD;
-but certainly as many as he had put in the basket, and&#xD;
more. Faith did not read them, either, at first,-till the&#xD;
repetition-or the way ~f it, told what they were; the glad&#xD;
saying that; she was his, beyond any one's power to buy her,&#xD;
-more than all, an indemnification to himself for all the&#xD;
gold he could not lay at her feet'! There needed no speech&#xD;
to tell her both.&#xD;
A word or two had answered his demonstrations, first a&#xD;
wondering ~rord, and then afterwards a low repetition of his&#xD;
name, in alone of humble recognition and protest. Now&#xD;
she looked up at him with a child's clear face, full of the&#xD;
colour he had brought into it.&#xD;
"Little darling," he said, "you will have your hands full&#xD;
of business P'&#xD;
"Oh Endy-J am very sorry !"&#xD;
"Sorry ?" Mr. Linden said. "What about ?"&#xD;
"I'm sorry. that basket has come here!"&#xD;
"It gives you the means of making other people glad."&#xD;
"Yes-but,"..2-Faith looked uncomfortably at the basket.&#xD;
Then brought her eyes back to Mr. Linden's face. "What&#xD;
ought II to do, Endecott ?"&#xD;
"The most goo~l and the least harm you can in the&#xD;
circumstances."&#xD;
"How shall 1,-the last ?"-she said with a ,manner like&#xD;
a beautiful child, truth struggling through embarrassment.&#xD;
"If you could contrive to make yourself disenchanting !"~'&#xD;
Faith passed that, and waited, her eyes making a grave&#xD;
appeal. 2Nfr. Linden smiled.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am afraid you can oniy be yourself," he said. "And&#xD;
j~ Dr. Harrison will not remove himself to a safe distance,&#xD;
there is not much to be done, except with the money. Let&#xD;
him understand that you consent for once to be his almoner,&#xD;
merely because you know better than he where the need is,&#xD;
.....that you take from him, as from anybody, a donation for&#xD;
your poor and sick neighbours."               x&#xD;
"Must I write ?"&#xD;
"But, Endecott-is that all ?"&#xD;
All that I need say. You never did encourage him,&#xD;
Faith,-it may be a long time before he gives you a chance&#xD;
to discourage. There is one thing I can do, if you wish."&#xD;
She had stood with an awakened, sorrowful look, the&#xD;
colour burning all over face and brow. Now she startled&#xD;
and asked "What?"&#xD;
"Something you do not wish. I can tell him that you&#xD;
belong to me." But that indeed Faith did not wish.&#xD;
"Oh no, Endecott-... IL would rather manage it some&#xD;
other way. Now don't Jet us lose any more of our afternoon&#xD;
with it-but come and tell me what will be the best things&#xD;
to do with this money."&#xD;
"It is hard to tell all at once," Mr. Linden said as they&#xD;
once more took their seats by the fire. "What have you&#xD;
thought of yourself?"&#xD;
"I know where one or two blankets are wanting. And&#xD;
0, Endy! there is one place where I should like to send&#xD;
a rocking..chair-ever so common a one, you know. "&#xD;
"And if Ency Stephens had one of those little self.loco-&#xD;
motive carriages, she could go about by herself all day&#xD;
long."&#xD;
"How good that would be! as soon as the spring opens.&#xD;
You could send one up from INew York, Endecott. Do&#xD;
they cost much ?"&#xD;
"I think not. And what do you say to taking a little&#xD;
portion of this for the beginning of a free library for the&#xD;
poor people ? If the thing were once begun, Mr. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh would dive you what you please to carry it on,-and&#xD;
Mr. Simlins ~ould help,-and so would I."&#xD;
"I was thinking o~ books !". said Faith, her eye dancing&#xD;
in an unknown 'library' ;-'~' but these would be books to&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
lend. I think a great many would like that, Endecott! o&#xD;
yes, we could get plenty of help. That is a delightf~~&#xD;
plan !-J don't think I ought to be sorry that basket came,&#xD;
after all," she added smiling. Mr. Linden smiled too-.-~she&#xD;
was a pretty Lady Bountiful!&#xD;
"Faith," he said, "suppose (it is a very presumptuou5&#xD;
supposition, but one may suppose anything) suppose when&#xD;
my hands are free to take care of my Mignonette, that J&#xD;
should have the offer of two or three different gardens&#xD;
wherein to place her. How should I choose ?"&#xD;
She coloured and looked at him somewhat inquiringly,&#xD;
then turned away with a kept-in but very pretty smile. "I&#xD;
know," she said, "how you would choose and you would&#xD;
not ask me."&#xD;
Yes I should, little unbeliever-.J ask you now."&#xD;
"You would go," she said gravely-" where your hands&#xD;
were most wanted."&#xD;
"There spoke a true Sunbeam !" said Mr. Linden. But&#xD;
perhaps the word-or something in the changing light of&#xD;
the afternoon -carried his thoughts on to the night train&#xD;
which was to bear him away; for he left Dr. Harrison, and&#xD;
baskets, and schemes, in the background; a~~d drawing her&#xD;
closer to his side talked of her affairs-what she had been&#xD;
doing, what she meax~t to do, in various ways,-trying to&#xD;
leave as it were a sort of network of his care about her.&#xD;
Then came twilight, and Mrs. Derrick and tea; with Faith's&#xD;
light figure flitting to and fro in preparation; and then&#xD;
prayers. And then-how fast the clock ticked! how fast&#xD;
the minutes began to run away!&#xD;
The storm did not rest,-it blew and beat and poured&#xD;
down as hard as evei~ eddying~ round the house in gusts&#xD;
that made every word and every minute within doors seem&#xD;
quieter and sweeter. And the words were many, and the&#xD;
minutes too-yet they dropped away one by one, and the&#xD;
upper glass was empty!&#xD;

CHAPTER XVJ.&#xD;
F AITH fortified herself with a triple wall of mental&#xD;
resolves against Dr. Harrison's advances. But when&#xD;
the doctor came again, a night or two after Thanksgiving,&#xD;
there did not seem to be much that she could do-or hin-&#xD;
der. The doctor's lines of circumvallation were too skil.-&#xD;
fully drawn for an inexperienced warrior like Faith to know&#xD;
very well where to oppose him. lie was not in a demon-&#xD;
strative mood at all; rather more quiet than usual. He&#xD;
had just pushed an advanced work in the shape of his&#xD;
golden cake; and he rested there for the present~&#xD;
To Faith's great joy, midway in the evening the doctor's&#xD;
monopoly was broken by the entrance of Squire Stouten-&#xD;
burgh and a very round game of talk. Faith seized the&#xD;
opportunity to present her claim for a free library-an-&#xD;
swered with open hand on the spot. And when he was&#xD;
gone, she sat meditating a speech, but she was prevented.&#xD;
The doctor, as if unconsciously amusing himself:, started a&#xD;
chemical question; and went on to give Faith a most ex-&#xD;
quisite analysis and illustration. It was impossible to listen&#xD;
coldly; it was impossible to maintain reserve. Faith must&#xD;
be herself; and delight shone in every feature. Now could&#xD;
Dr. Harrison enjoy this thoroughly and yet give no sign&#xD;
that he did so~ his eye watched hers, while Faith thought&#xD;
he was looking into depths of science; his smile was a keen&#xD;
reflection of that on her lips, while she fancied it called&#xD;
forth only by his own skill, o~r success, or scientific power.&#xD;
lie had produced the very effect he wanted; for the moment,&#xD;
he had her all to himself.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he said gently, as his demonstration came&#xD;
to an end,-" you may command me fQr that library."&#xD;
Faith drew back and her mind returned to business again.&#xD;
The doctor saw it, and was instantly sorry he had started&#xD;
the subject.&#xD;
"I was going to speak to you about that, Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
If you have no objection, I shall take a little of that money&#xD;

&#xD;
you entrusted to me, for it-the beginning of it. Only a&#xD;
little. The rest shall go as J suppose you meant it to go."&#xD;
"12 knew it was very su~e to go right after it got into&#xD;
your hands. I don't thin ki followed it any further."&#xD;
"It will make a great many people happy this winter,&#xD;
Dr. Harrison.~~&#xD;
"I hope it will," said he very sincerely; for he knew that&#xD;
if it made them it would her.&#xD;
"You have little notion how much," Faith went on&#xD;
gravely. "I will do the best I can with it,.-a.nd if you&#xD;
had patience to hear, I would let you know what, Dr. liar..&#xD;
rison."&#xD;
"You do me less than justice, Miss Faith. You can&#xD;
hear me rant about philosophical niceties,-and yet think&#xD;
that I ~vould not have patience to listen to a lecture from&#xD;
you upon my neglected duties 1"&#xD;
"I didn't mean that, sir."&#xD;
lie gave her a genial, recognizing little smile, which was&#xD;
not exactly in his "part ".-but came in spite of him.&#xD;
"Do you know, I should like to hear it, Miss Faith. I&#xD;
always like lectures illustrated. What have you done&#xD;
already ?"&#xD;
"There is an almost bed-ridden woman two miles off,&#xD;
who will bless somebody all winter for the comfort of a&#xD;
rocking-chair-all her life, I may rather say ;-a common&#xD;
wooden one, Dr. Harrison,"&#xD;
"That is a capital idea," said the doctor. "She will&#xD;
bless you, I hope."&#xD;
"No, certainly! 12 shall tell her the money is not mine,&#xD;
.-I am only laying it out for a kind somebody."&#xD;
"Miss Faith," said the doctor,-" I am not kind !"&#xD;
"I think you are,"-was her gentle, somewhat wistful&#xD;
answer. The doctor sprung up.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick," said he with all his comicality alive,-&#xD;
"Miss Faith promised me a piece of pumpkin pie."&#xD;
He had it, and taking his old place on the rug slowly&#xD;
demolished it, qualifying every morsel with such ridiculous&#xD;
correlative remarks, allusions, and propositions,-that it&#xD;
was beyond the power of either Mrs. Derrick or Faith to&#xD;
retain her gravity. But the moment the door closed upon&#xD;
him, Faith looked sober.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, child ?" said her mother.&#xD;
"Well, mother-I haven't written my French."&#xD;
.And she sat down to write it, but studied something else.&#xD;
"Manage it some other way "-she had said she would; it&#xD;
w~s not easy! What was she going to do? the doctor&#xD;
asked nothing of her but ordinary civility; how could she&#xD;
refuse him that? It was a puzzle, and Faith found it so&#xD;
as the weeks went on. It seemed to be as Mr. Linden had&#xD;
said; that she could do little but be as she had been, her-&#xD;
self. That did not satisfy Faith.&#xD;
It was a great relief, when about the middle of Decem-&#xD;
ber the family went to New York for a few weeks, and Dr.&#xD;
Harrison went with his family. Once more she breathed&#xD;
freely. Then Faith and Reuben made themselves very&#xD;
busy in preparing for the Christmas doings. Means enough&#xD;
were on hand now. Reuben was an invaluable auxiliary&#xD;
as a scout ;-.--to find out where anything was pressingly&#xD;
wanted and what; and long lists were made, and many&#xD;
traIns laid in readiness against Mr. Lin~ n's arrival. And&#xD;
then he came!&#xD;
It was for a good week's holiday this time, and how it&#xD;
was enjoyed two people knew-which ~was enough. Stu-&#xD;
dies went on after the old fashion during that week, and&#xD;
dinners and teas out made some unavoidable interruptions,&#xD;
yet not on the whole unpleasant. And sleigh rides were&#xD;
taken, day and nio~ht and walks and talks not to be man-&#xD;
tioned. Then the 2Newyear's visiting-with such a budget&#xD;
of new varieties !-how pleasant it was to go that round&#xD;
again together; and it was hard to make short visits, for&#xD;
everybody wanted to see and hear so much of Mr. Linden.&#xD;
He stayed one extra day after that-to see Faith when he&#xD;
had done seeing everybody else, but then he went; and the&#xD;
coldness and quiet of winter set in, broken only by letters.&#xD;
There was a break of another kind when Dr. Harrison&#xD;
came back, in the middle of January; such a break to&#xD;
Faith's quiet that the coldness was well nigh forgotten.&#xD;
She had doubly resolved she would have a~s little as possi-&#xD;
ble to do with him; and found presently she was having&#xD;
quite as much as ever.&#xD;
The plan of rendering him a grave account of what she&#xD;
bad done or was doing with his money, so far as the plan&#xD;

&#xD;
regarded keeping him at a distance, was a signal failure.&#xD;
Very simply and honestly it was done, on her part; but it&#xD;
suited the doctor admirably; nothing could better serve his&#xD;
purposes. Dr. Harrison heard jier communication about&#xD;
some relieved family or project of relief, with a pleasant&#xD;
sort of attention and intelligence; and had skill, although&#xD;
really and professedly unwanted in the like things, to take&#xD;
up her plans and make the most happy suggestions and&#xD;
additions--often growing a large scheme upon a small one,&#xD;
and edging in the additional means so insensibly, so quietly,&#xD;
that though Faith saw he did it she could not tell how to&#xD;
binder and did not know that she ought. Mr. Linden had&#xD;
sent, as he prQmised, his help for the library,-indeed sent&#xD;
from time to time some new parcel; and without inquiring&#xD;
whether the money he had left for his poor people was&#xD;
exhausted, had sent her a fresh supply. But she had noue&#xD;
too much, from all sources. It was a winter of great&#xD;
severity among the poorer portion of the community;&#xD;
work was hard to come by, and the intense weatherr made&#xD;
food and clothing and firing doubly in demand. There&#xD;
were few starving poor people in Pattaquasset; but many&#xD;
that winter lacked comforts, and some would have wanted&#xD;
bread, without the diligent care of their better-off neigh-&#xD;
bours. And there as everywhere, those who gave such&#xD;
care were few. Faith and Reuben had plenty to do. But&#xD;
indeed not merely, nor chie~y, with the furnishing of food&#xD;
to the hungry and firing to the cold; neither were those&#xD;
the points where Dr. Harrison's assistance came most help-&#xD;
fully in.&#xD;
Little Ency Stephens wanted a Ilower now and then, as&#xD;
well as a velocipede; and Dr. harrison gave-not to Faith,&#xD;
but to Faith's hands for her-a nice little monthly rose-&#xD;
bush out of the greenhouse. How it smiled in the poor&#xD;
cottage and omi the ailing child I-and what could Faith do&#xD;
but with a swelling heart to wish good to the giver. A&#xD;
smoky chimney was putting out the eyes of a poor seani~&#xD;
stress. Dr. Harrison 'quietly gave Reuben orders to have&#xD;
a certain top put to the chimney and send the bill to him.&#xD;
He even seemed to be undertaking some things on his own&#xD;
account. Faith heard through Reuben that he had pru.&#xD;
cured the office of post-mistress in Pattaquasset to be given&#xD;
&#xD;
to the distressed family she and Mr. Linden had visited~ at&#xD;
Neantidut; and that Mrs. Tuck and Mintie were settled at&#xD;
the post-office, in all comfort accordingly. But worst of&#xD;
all! there were some sick people; and one or two for whom&#xD;
Faith dared not refuse his offer to go with her to see them.&#xD;
Dared still less after the first time he had actually gone; so&#xD;
great and immediate she found the value, not of his medi~&#xD;
cineS only, but of the word or two of hint and direction&#xD;
which he gave her towards their help and healing. Faith&#xD;
began to look forward to May with a breath of almost im-&#xD;
1)atienee. But a change came before that.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
T XIIE spring caine, with all its genial influences.  ~ot&#xD;
now with such expeditions as the last spring had&#xD;
seen, but with letters to take their place, and with walks&#xD;
of business and kindness instead of pleasure. Yes, of&#xD;
pleasure too ; and Faith began to find her "knight" not&#xD;
only a help and safeguard, but good company. Reuben&#xD;
was so true, ~o simple and modest-x~as walking in such a&#xD;
swift path of improvement; was so devoted to Faith and&#xD;
her interests, besides the particular bond of sympathy be-&#xD;
tween them, that she might have had many a brother and&#xD;
fared much worse. The intercourse had not changed its&#xD;
character outwardly-Reuben's simple ceremonial of re-&#xD;
spect and deference was as strict as ever; but the thor-&#xD;
ough liking of first acquaintanceship had deepened into&#xD;
very warm affection on both sides. With Dr. Harrison&#xD;
Reuben gained no ground-or the doctor did not with&#xD;
him. Though often working for him and with him, though&#xD;
invariably courteous ~vith the most respectful propriety,&#xD;
Faith could see that Reuben's old feeling was rather on&#xD;
the increase.&#xD;
With the spring thaw came a freshc~. It came suddenly,&#xD;
at the end of the week; every river and stream rising into&#xD;
a full tide of insurrection with the melting snows of Sattir-&#xD;
day, and Saturday night bridges and mill-dams went by the&#xD;
hoard. Among the rest, one of the railway bridges near&#xD;
Pattaquasset gave way, and a full train from the east set&#xD;
down its freight of passengers in Pattaquasset. over Sun-&#xD;
day. They amused themselves variously-as such freight&#xD;
in such circumstances is wont to do. Faith knew that the&#xD;
church was well filled that Sunday morx4~g, but the fact or&#xD;
the cause concerned her little-did not disturb th~ quiet&#xD;
path of her thoughts and steps, until church was out and&#xD;
she coming home, alone that day, as it happened. Then&#xD;
she found the walk full and her walk hindered. Especially&#xD;
by two gentlemen-who as the others thinned ofl, right and&#xD;
(222)&#xD;
&#xD;
left, still went straight on; not fast enough to get away&#xD;
from Faith nor slow enough for her to pass them. They&#xD;
were strangers, evidently, and town bred. One of them&#xD;
reminded Faith of Dr. Harrison, in dress and1 style-both&#xD;
belonged to a class of which she had seen few specimens.&#xD;
But she gave them little heed (save as they detained her,)&#xD;
nor cared at all for their discussion of the weather, or&#xD;
the place. Then suddenly her attention was caught and&#xD;
held.&#xD;
"By the way I" said one-" this is the very place where&#xD;
Linden was so long."&#xD;
"Who? Endecott Linden ?" said Dr. Harrison's like-&#xD;
ness~. "What was he here for ?"&#xD;
"Teaching school."&#xD;
"Teaching school I" echoed the other,-"Endecott Lin-&#xD;
den teaching school !-Pegasus in pound !-How did the&#xD;
rustics catch him ?"&#xD;
"Pegasus came of' his own accord, if I remember."&#xD;
"Pshaw, yes I-.--but Linden.' For what conceivable rea-&#xD;
son did he let himself down to teach school ?"&#xD;
"lie didn't-" said the other a little hotly. "He wouldn't&#xD;
let himself down if he turned street-sweeper."&#xD;
"True-he has a sort of natural dais which he carries&#xD;
about with him,-L suppose he'd make the crossing the&#xD;
court end. But I say, what did he do this for ?"&#xD;
"Why-for money 1" said the first speaker. "What an&#xD;
ado about nothing!"&#xD;
"inconceivable! Just imagine, George, a man who can&#xD;
sing as he does, teaching a, b, ab !"&#xD;
"Well-imagine it," said George,-" and then you'll&#xD;
wish you were six years old to have him teach you."&#xD;
"How cross you are," said his friend lazily. "And&#xD;
despotic. Was there nothing left of all that immense&#xD;
property? I've just come home, you know."&#xD;
"Not much," said G\eorge. "A little-but Endecott&#xD;
wouldn't touch that-it was all put at interest for Miss&#xD;
Pet. lie would have it so, and even supported her as&#xD;
long as she staid in the country. What he works sd hard&#xD;
for now I don't understand."&#xD;
"Works, does he? I thought he was studying for&#xD;
the church-going to bury himself again. It's a crying&#xD;

shame! why he might be member, minister, Secretary,&#xD;

"He !" cried George in hot. disdain,-" he soil his fingers&#xD;
with politics! No-he's in the right place now,-- there's&#xD;
no other pure enough for him."&#xD;
"I didn't know you admired the church so much," said&#xD;
his friend ironically.&#xD;
"I don't-only the place in it where he'll Btand. That's&#xD;
grand."&#xD;
"And so he's at work yet ?"&#xD;
"Yes indeed--and it puzzles me. That year here ought&#xD;
to have carried him through his studies."&#xD;
"Why what can he do ?-not teach school now,-he's no&#xD;
time for it."&#xD;
"He can give lessons-and does. Makes the time, I&#xD;
suppose. You know he' has learned about everything but&#xD;
Theology. Oliph~nt was telling me about it the other day."&#xD;
"What a strange thing !" said the other musingly,-.&#xD;
"such a family, so swept 'overboard! What a house that&#xD;
was! You remember his mother, George ?"&#xD;
"I should think so !.--and the way Eudecott used to sing&#xD;
to her every night, no matter who was there."&#xD;
"Yes," said the doctor's confr~re-" and come to her to&#xD;
be kissed afterwards. I should have laughed at any other&#xD;
rnan-but it set well on him. So did her diamond ring in&#xD;
his hair, which she was so fond of handling. How did he&#xD;
make out to live when she died ?"&#xD;
"I don't know-" said George with a half drawn breath-.&#xD;
a little reverently too: "I suppose he could tell you. But&#xD;
all that first year nobody saw him-unless somebody in&#xD;
need or sorrow: they could always find him. He looked as&#xD;
if he had taken leave of the world-except to work for it."&#xD;
"How courted he used to be !"-.----said the other-" how&#xD;
petted-not 'spoiled, strange to say. Do you suppose he'll&#xD;
ever marry, George? will he ever find any one to suit his&#xD;
notions? He's had enough to choose from already-in&#xD;
Europe and here. What do they say of him off yonder-.&#xD;
where ho is now&#xD;
"They say he's-rock crystal,-because ice will melt,"&#xD;
said George. "So I suppose his notions are as high as ever."&#xD;
"You used to admire Miss Linden, if L remember," said&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
his friend. "What a ring that was !---I wonder if she's&#xD;
got it. George-I sha'n't walk any further in this mud-.&#xD;
turn about."&#xD;
Which the two did, suddenly. Both stepped aside out&#xD;
of Faith's way, in surprise-her light footfall had not&#xD;
jnade them lower their voices. But in that moment they&#xD;
~~uld see that she was a lady; in acknowledgment of which&#xD;
fact the one gentleman bowed slightly, and the other lifted&#xD;
his hat. Faith had thrown back her veil to hear better&#xD;
what they were saying, not expecting so sudden an encoun-&#xD;
ter; and as she passed, secure in being a stranger, gave&#xD;
them both a view of as soft a pair of eyes as they had&#xD;
either of them ever looked into, which also sought theirs&#xD;
with a curious intentness, borne out by the high bright&#xD;
tinge which excitement had brought into her cheeks.&#xD;
Both of them saw and remembered, for swift as it was, the&#xD;
look was not one to forget. But the glance added lit-&#xD;
tle to what Faith knew already about the strangers, and&#xD;
she went on her way feeling as if a stricture had been&#xD;
bound tight round her heart.&#xD;
The words about Mr. Linden's fastidiousness she knew&#xD;
quite enough of him to verify; and in the light of these&#xD;
people's talk it almost seemed to Faith as if there had&#xD;
been some glamour about her-as if she should some day&#xD;
prove to be ~' magician's coin" after all. *But though the&#xD;
old sense of unworthiness swept over her, Faith was not&#xD;
of a teixiper to dwell long or heavily upon such a doubt.&#xD;
Her heart had been strangely stirred besides by what was&#xD;
said of hi~ mother, and his old way of life, and his changes.&#xD;
She knew about them of course before; yet as a trifle, the&#xD;
touching of a single ray, will often give a new view of an&#xD;
old scene,-those side words of strangers set all Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den's time of joy and sorrow with such vivid reality before&#xD;
her, that her heart was like to break with it. That effect&#xD;
too, more or less, passed away from her mind,-never&#xD;
entirely. Another thing staid.&#xD;
"What he works so hard for now" 'Then he was work-&#xD;
ing hard! and doing his own studies and correcting her&#xD;
French exercises, and giving her lessons all the while, as&#xD;
well as to other people; and bringing her gifts with the&#xD;
fruit of his work! And not an atom of it all could Faith&#xD;

touch to change. She pondered it, and she knew it. She&#xD;
doubted whether she could with any good effect venture so&#xD;
much as a remonstrance; and the more Faith thought, the&#xD;
more this doubt resolved itself into certainty. And all the&#xD;
whil~, he was working hard! Round that fact her thoughts&#xD;
beat, like an alarmed bird round its nest; about as help.&#xD;
lessly.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick thought Faith was more grave and ab.&#xD;
stracted than usual that day, and sometimes thought so&#xD;
afterwards; that was all Faith made known.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison thought the same thing on the next occa-&#xD;
sion of his seeing her, and on the next; or rather he&#xD;
thought she held off from him more than usual; what the&#xD;
root of it might be he was uncertain. And circumstances&#xD;
were unfavorable to the exactness of his observations for&#xD;
some time thereafter.&#xD;
It was yet early in March, when Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
took a very troublesome and tedious fever, which lasted&#xD;
several weeks. It was reckoned dangerous, part of the&#xD;
time, and Mrs. Derrick and Faith were in very constant&#xD;
attendance. Faith especially, for Mrs. Stoutenburgh liked&#xD;
no one else so well about her; and gratitude and re.&#xD;
gard made her eager to do all she might. So daily and&#xD;
nightly she was at Mrs. Stoutenburgh 's bedside, ministering&#xD;
to her in all the gentle offices of a nurse, and in that line&#xD;
besides where Mr. Linden had declared Dr. Harrison but&#xD;
half knew his profession. And there, and about this work,&#xD;
Dr. Harrison met her.&#xD;
Their meetings were of necessity very often; but no lec.&#xD;
tures, nor discussions, nor much conversation, were now&#xD;
possible. Faith felt she had a vantage-ground, and used&#xD;
it. The doctor felt he had lost ground, or at the least was&#xD;
not gaining; and against some felt but unrecognized obsta~&#xD;
cle in his way his curiosity and passion chaft~d. He could&#xD;
see Fai~h nowhere else now; she contrived not to meet&#xD;
him at home. She was out with Reuben-or resting-or&#xD;
unavoidably busy, when he came there. And Dr. Harrison&#xD;
knew the resting times were needed, and could only fume&#xD;
against the business-in which he sometimes had same reason.&#xD;
One day he found her at her post in the sick room,&#xD;
when Mrs. Stoutenburgh had fallen asleep. It was to~&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                 227.&#xD;
wards the end of the afternoon. An open Bible lay on&#xD;
the bed's side; and Faith sat there resting her head on&#xD;
her hand. She was thinking how hard Mr. Linden w~s&#xD;
working, and herself looking somewhat as if she were fob&#xD;
lowing his example.&#xD;
"What are you doing ?" said the doctor softly.&#xD;
"I have been reading to Mrs. Stoutenburgh."&#xD;
"Feverish-" whispered the doctor.&#xD;
"No ;-she has gone to sleep."&#xD;
"Tired her !-"&#xD;
"No," said Faith with a smile, "it's resting. Th~ Bible&#xD;
never tired any one yet, that loved it~-J think."&#xD;
"Well people-" said the doctor.&#xD;
"Sick people! You're mistaken, Dr. Harrison. Sick&#xD;
people most of all."&#xD;
"Do you know that you will be sick next," said he&#xD;
gravely, "if you do not takd more care?"&#xD;
A fair little smile denied any fear or care on that sub-&#xD;
ject, but did not satisfy the doctor.&#xD;
"I do not approve of what you are doing," said he&#xD;
seriously.&#xD;
"Reading this ?"&#xD;
"Even the same."&#xD;
"But you are mistaken, Dr. Harrison," she said gently.&#xD;
"There is nothing so soothing, to those that love it. I&#xD;
wish you loved it! Don't you remember you confessed to&#xD;
me once that somebody had told you you had but half&#xD;
learned your profession ?"&#xD;
Faith trembled, for she had said those last words wit-&#xD;
tingly. She could not have spoken them, if the light in&#xD;
the room had not been such as to hide her change of&#xD;
colour; and even then she dared not speak the name she&#xD;
alluded to. But she had said it half as a matter of con-&#xD;
It drew forth no answer from the doctor, for Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh just then stirred and awoke. And Faith&#xD;
little guessed the train she had touched. There were no&#xD;
indications of manner; and she could not, as Dr. Harrison&#xD;
went leisurely down the stairs, see the tremendous bound&#xD;
his mind made with the question,-&#xD;
"Is it that book that stands in my way ?-~-or HE&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIJT.&#xD;
M RS. STOUTENBURGH got well. And it was in&#xD;
Faith's mind then, by some means to see very little&#xD;
more of Dr. Harrison till Mr. Linden should be in Pattaquas.&#xD;
set again. So much for human intentions. Faith fell sick&#xD;
herself; and instead of being kept at a distance Dr. liar.&#xD;
rison saw her twice at least in the twenty-four hours.&#xD;
It was a doubtful privilege to see those soft eyes lustroug&#xD;
with fever and a steady glow take place of the changing&#xD;
and flitting hues which were as much a part of Faith's lan-&#xD;
guage, at times, as the movements of a horse's ears are part&#xD;
of his. But as after a few days it became evident that&#xD;
there was nothing dangerous about Faith's attack, it is&#xD;
probable that the doctor rather enjoyed his position than&#xD;
otherwise. The freedom and authority of his office were a&#xD;
pleasant advance upon the formalities of ordinary inter.&#xD;
course; and to see Faith and speak to her and touch her&#xD;
hand without any ceremonial but that of friendship, was an&#xD;
advantage great enough to desire the prolonging thereof.&#xD;
Faith was a gentle patient; and Dr. Harrison's care was&#xD;
unbounded; though it was not alarming, even to Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick, as he assured her there was no cause.&#xD;
For a week however Faith kept her bed, and even Dr.&#xD;
Harrison was glad when at the end of a week she was able&#xD;
to be up again. Especially perhaps as it was only in her&#xD;
wrapper and an easy-chair; his office was not at an end;&#xD;
the fever, in a remittent or intermittent form, still hung&#xD;
about her and forbade her doing anything but taking care&#xD;
of herself.&#xD;
Not precisely in this category of duty were the letters&#xD;
Faith had written all that week. She had written them,&#xD;
how was best known by an aching head and burning&#xD;
fingers and feverish vision. But an interruption of them&#xD;
would have drawn on Mr. Linden's knowing the reason;&#xD;
(228)&#xD;
&#xD;
and then Faith knew that no considerati~14~Qiild keep&#xD;
him from coming to her. It was towards~ ~~jd~of~tlie&#xD;
study terifl he was working hard already; ~he~cQITiId ~r~it&#xD;
endure that any farther bar should be placed in hi~ I~rt~y;&#xD;
None should for her. And so, bit by bit when she could&#xD;
do but a bit at a time, the letters were written. Exercises&#xD;
had to be excused. And Faith was a third very thankful&#xD;
when at the end of' a sick week, she was able to get up and&#xD;
be dressed and sit in the easy-chair and see the diamonds&#xD;
sparkling against her brown wrapper again.&#xD;
It was April now, and a soft springy day. A. fire burned&#xD;
gently in the chimney, while a window open at a little dis~&#xD;
tance let in Spring's whispers and fragrances; and the plain&#xD;
old-fashioned room looked cozy and pretty, as some rooms&#xD;
will look under undefinable influences. Nothing.could be&#xD;
plainer. There was not even the quaint elegance of Mr.&#xD;
Linden's room; this one was wainscotted with light blue&#xD;
and whitewashed, and furnished with the simplest of chintz&#xD;
furniture. But its simplicity and purity were all in tone&#xD;
with the Spring air and the cheer of the wood fire; and not&#xD;
at all a bad setting for the figure that sat there in the great&#xD;
chintz chair before the fire; her soft hair in bright order,&#xD;
the quiet brown folds of the wrapper enveloping her, and&#xD;
the flash of the diamonds giving curious point and effect to&#xD;
the whole picture. Faith was alone and looking very&#xD;
happy.&#xD;
It wanted but a few weeks now of Mr. Linden's coming&#xD;
home,-coruing home for a longer rest and sight of her; and&#xD;
Faith had not seen him since January. Mrs. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh's illness and Faith's consequent fatigue had in part&#xD;
accounted to him for the short letters and missing French&#xD;
exercises, but she could see that such excuse would not long&#xD;
be made for her,.-his last one or two letters had been more&#xD;
anxious, more special in their inquiries: how glad she was&#xD;
that he need have no further cause for either. Partly&#xD;
musing on all this, partly on what she had been reading,&#xD;
Faith sat that afternoon, when the well-known single soft&#xD;
knock at her door announced Reuben Taylor. He came in&#xD;
with a glad face-how sad it had lately been Faith had&#xD;
seen, sick as she was,-and with both hands full of pleasant&#xD;
things. One hand was literally full, of~ cowslips; and as he&#xD;

came up and gave her his other hand, it seemed to Faith a~&#xD;
if a gre~%t spot of Spring gold was before her eyes.&#xD;
"Dear Miss Faith," Reuben said, "I wonder if anybody&#xD;
can ever be thankful enough, to, see you better! You feel&#xD;
stronger than yesterday, don't you, ina'am ?"&#xD;
"I can't be thankful enough, Reuben-I feel that to-day.&#xD;
How good you are to bring me those cowslips! 0 yes,--...&#xD;
I am stronger than I was yesterday."&#xD;
That Faith was not very strong was sufficiently shewn by&#xD;
the way her hands lay in her lap and on the arm of the&#xD;
chair, and by the lines of her pale quiet face. B@dily&#xD;
strength was not flourishing there. Reuben looked at her&#xD;
wistfully, with a half-choked sigh7 then knelt down beside&#xD;
her chair, as he often did.&#xD;
"I didn't bring them all, Miss Faith-I mean, I didn't;&#xD;
pick them all. Charlie and Robbie saw me in the meadow,&#xD;
and nothing would do but they must help. I don't think&#xD;
they always knew which to pick-.-.-.-but I thought you wouldn't&#xD;
mind that," he said as he laid the cowslips on the table,&#xD;
their f~iir yellow faces showing very fair in the sick room.&#xD;
Faith's face was bright before, but it brightened still.&#xD;
"They look lovely to me-tell Charlie and Rob I will&#xD;
thank them when I can. I don't thank you, Reuben,"-she&#xD;
said turning from the flowers to him.&#xD;
"No, ma'am, I should hope not," he said, answering her&#xD;
smile gratefully. "But that's not all, Miss Faith-for Ency&#xD;
Stephens sent you one of her rosebuds,".-.-.-and Reuben took&#xD;
a little parcel carefully from his pocket. "It's only wrapped&#xD;
up in brown paper, because I hadn't time to go home for&#xD;
white. And she told m~ to tell you, Miss Faith," he added,&#xD;
both eyes and cheek flushing-" that she prays every&#xD;
day for you to get well and for Mr. Linden to come home."&#xD;
The smile died on Faith's face and her eyes fell. "1-Je&#xD;
ought to have this," she said presently, with a little flush on&#xD;
her own cheek. "I don't feel as if it should come to me.&#xD;
Reuben, c~oes she want anything ?" It was very rare,&#xD;
even now, for Faith to speak directly to Reuben of Mr.&#xD;
Linden, though she was ready enough to hear Reuben&#xD;
speak of him.&#xD;
"No, ina'am, I think not," he said in answer to her ques..&#xD;
tion. "You know...~.~~did you ever hear, Miss Faith ?-that&#xD;
&#xD;
AND S~AL.                 231&#xD;
when Mr. Linden first xvent there she was kept in the&#xD;
house the whole time,--.-nobody knew how to take her out-..&#xD;
or took the trouble; and Mr. Linden carried her half a&#xD;
mile down the lane that very first day. And you can guess&#xD;
how he talked to her, Miss Faith,-they said she looked&#xD;
like another child when she caine back. But is there any-&#xD;
thing I can do for you, ma'am, before I go to the post-&#xD;
office ?-it'5 almost time."&#xD;
"If you'll fill that glass with water for me, Reuben-.-..&#xD;
that I mayn't let my sweet cowslips fade-that's all. They'll&#xD;
do me good all to-morrow."&#xD;
Reuben went off, his place presently supplied by Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh; ~~ho against all persuasion had insisted upon&#xD;
coming down to see I~aith. And then Faith was left to&#xD;
the calm companionship of her cowslips till Reuben came&#xD;
back from the&#xD;
He came up to Faith's chair, and taking out the letter&#xD;
broke the outer seal, (a ceremony he generally performed in&#xD;
her presence) and was just removing the envelope when the&#xD;
doctor came in for his evening visit. The doctor saw a&#xD;
tableau,-.-.Faith, the cowslips, and R~uben,-..-Mrs. Derri4k&#xD;
by the window he hardly saw, nor what the others were&#xD;
about. But that he had interrupted something was clear--&#xD;
the very atmosphere of the room was startled; and though&#xD;
Reuben's position hid both letter and hands, it was certain&#xD;
the hands were busy. What was in them, and what became&#xD;
of it, the doctor could not tell. Before he was fairly in the&#xD;
room the letter had retreated to IReuben's pocket, and&#xD;
Reuben stepped back and stood behind Faith's chair.&#xD;
The doctor laid a hand on his shoulder with a 'How&#xD;
do you do' as he passed; and accosted Faith with all the&#xD;
free kindliness which his office of physician permitted him&#xD;
to add to the friend. The doctor took all his advantage;&#xD;
he did not take more; and not Faith herself could see that&#xD;
there was any warmer feeling behind his pleasant and&#xD;
pleased eye and smile. But it is true Faith was .a simple-&#xD;
ton. She did not see that his pleasantness covered keen&#xD;
scrutiny. The scrutiny found nothing.&#xD;
"How do you do ?"~he said.&#xD;
"I don't suppose I need say a word to tell you," Faith&#xD;
answered smiling. "I am well, enough to enjoy cowslips."&#xD;

&#xD;
The doctor's eye fell slightingly upon them, which was&#xD;
not wonderful.&#xD;
"I think you must be very well !" he said with. some&#xD;
trifle of addenda from lip and, eye. "You see you are&#xD;
mistaken. I shouldn't have known how well, except fr~~i&#xD;
your words."&#xD;
"You are mistaken now, Dr. Harrison," said Faith in the&#xD;
slow quiet way in which she spoke to-day. "You think&#xD;
these are not splendid-but they are bits of spring !"&#xD;
"They are not Spring's best bits, I hope," said the&#xD;
doctor.&#xD;
"What do you think of that?"&#xD;
The doctor took the rosebud and looked at it.&#xD;
"If I were to tell you what I think of it," he said with a&#xD;
sort of grave candor, "you would dismiss me, and I should&#xD;
come here no more I"&#xD;
"Reuben brought me that, Dr. Harrison, from the little&#xD;
lame girl you sent the rosebush to, in the winter. I wish&#xD;
you knew how much good that rosebush has done ~&#xD;
"I sometimes wish," said the doctor, "that I had been&#xD;
born in a cottage !"&#xD;
"Why, in the world?"&#xD;
"It would be so pleasant to have people come and bring&#xD;
me rosebushes 1"&#xD;
"Or cowslips ?" said Faith. "Then you would have a&#xD;
taste for cowslips."&#xD;
"But then the people might get sick," said the doctor,&#xD;
waiving the 'bits of spring' ;-" so I am content. How&#xD;
are you to-day ?" He took Faith's hand and felt it, and&#xD;
looked at her. The result did not seem to be unsatisfactory&#xD;
on the whole.&#xD;
"You mustn't read too much in that book," said he,&#xD;
glancing over at it.&#xD;
"Why not ?"&#xD;
"You must keep quiet."&#xD;
"For how long ?"&#xD;
"It depends. There is a little enemy of fever hanging&#xD;
about your skirts, that I will oppose with something else;&#xD;
but all you can oppose to him is quietness."&#xD;
Faith thought of the words-" The rock of my defence&#xD;
&#xD;
232&#xD;
&#xD;
and my refuge ".-what quietness was like that of their&#xD;
giving; but she said nothing to the doctor.&#xD;
iDr. Harrison gave Mrs. Derrick her directions on various&#xD;
points; then taking his old-fashioned stand on the rug,&#xD;
surveyed the easy-chair and its occupant and Reuben still&#xD;
behind it.&#xD;
"By the way, Mrs. Derrick," said he carelessly, ..-.-" I&#xD;
have heard a pretty story of your friend iMr. Linden." He&#xD;
noticed, but only that Faith had glanced at him and was to&#xD;
0a11 appearance quietly looking down at her cowslips.&#xD;
"I dare say, doctor," said Mrs. Derrick placidly. "I've&#xD;
heard a great many.&#xD;
"Have you heard it ?"&#xD;
"Heard what ?" said Mrs. Derrick; "It's an old pretty&#xD;
story that everybody loves him."&#xD;
"J heard this only the other day," said the doctor. "It's&#xD;
not of that kind. But stories will be stories-and people&#xD;
will tell them."&#xD;
How the colour flushed and paled in Reuben's cheek 1--.&#xD;
he stood resting his hands lightly on the back of Faith's&#xD;
chair, looking down. The colour on Faith's cheek did not&#xD;
change.&#xD;
"Who told this ?" said Mi~s. Derrick.&#xD;
"People that have known the family. They say; he has&#xD;
managed to run through a very large property, and that he&#xD;
leaves his sister now to live upon charity."&#xD;
It was impossible to tell from the doctor's manner whether&#xD;
he put any faith in his story himself. It was as much like&#xD;
delivering a report as bringing a charge. It might have&#xD;
been either! He saw Reuben's colour become fixed and&#xD;
very high, but though the doctor could almost have sworn&#xD;
that there was a rush of hid tears nuder the boy's drooping&#xD;
eyelids, yet the lines about the mouth took the curl of an&#xD;
irrepressible smile. Mrs. Derrick picked up two stitches,&#xD;
made a third-then answered.&#xD;
"So that's virhat you call a pretty story! It was hardly&#xD;
worth remembering to tell us, doctor,- you and I, and&#xD;
Reuben, and Faith, know better." Now could not the&#xD;
doctor tell for the life of him, whether the words were sim-&#xD;
ply innocent, or-simply malicious! Mrs. Derrick was so&#xD;

imperturbable there, at her knittIng! Neither did the&#xD;
doctor much care. It sounded to him just like Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick. He looked at Faith; and remarked lightly that "lie&#xD;
didn't know anything !"&#xD;
Faith was very quiet; he could not see that her colour&#xD;
had risen more than a little, and a little was not enough to&#xD;
judge by in her face. But in an instant mere after he had&#xD;
spoken, she looked full and gravely up at him.&#xD;
"Do you believe everything about everybody, Dr. liar.&#xD;
rison ?"&#xD;
"On the contrary! I don't believe anything of anybody!&#xD;
-Except you," he added with a little smile.&#xD;
"Do, you believe such a story ?"&#xD;
Her steady soft eyes, which did not move from him, gave&#xD;
him an uncomfortable feeling-perhaps of undefined reinem..&#xD;
branch. "I don't believe it," he said returning her gaze.&#xD;
"I don't do anything with it. Such things are said of&#xD;
everybody-and of almost everybody they are true. I take&#xD;
them as they come. But about this particular case," he&#xD;
said with one of his gentle looks, "I will do just what you&#xD;
say I must do."&#xD;
Faith smiled.&#xD;
"I don't say you must do anything. I am sorry for you,&#xD;
Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"I am glad you are sorry !" he said sitting down by her.&#xD;
"And there is reason enough; but what is this one ?"&#xD;
"You lose a great pleasure."&#xD;
"What one ?"-.&#xD;
"You don't know ho~vto trust."&#xD;
"Do I not ?" said the doctor, looking at the rosebud still&#xD;
in his hand. "Well-.--..you shall teach me !" And spring.&#xD;
ing up he bowed to Mrs. Derrick and went off-rosebud&#xD;
and all.&#xD;
Reuben stood still for about half a minute-.-.then came&#xD;
round, and silently gave Faith her letter.&#xD;
"Reuben Taylor !".-said Faith, as he was going after&#xD;
the doctor. "You have been standing so iong.-suppose&#xD;
you sit down for a minute ?"&#xD;
Whatever Reuben thought of the request, he said no-&#xD;
thing, but obeyed her, bringing a foot cushion to her chair&#xD;
and bestowing himself upon it. Faith smiled at him as she&#xD;
&#xD;
spoke again, though there was an unwanted fire in her o*n&#xD;
eyes; and the blood came fast now to her face.&#xD;
"Reuben, I wanted to ask you what all that colour Is&#xD;
in your cheeks for ?"&#xD;
Reuben hesitated.-there seemed a stricture across his&#xD;
breast which made speaking hard work; but at last he said&#xD;
frankly, though in none of the clearest tones,&#xD;
"Because I'm angry, Miss Faith-and hurt too."&#xD;
Faith's next words fell like pearls.-.&#xD;
"It isn't worth the while."&#xD;
"No, Miss Faith," he answered without looking up.&#xD;
"It's too much honour to something that doesn't deserve&#xD;
ft,~and-Reuben--it'5 too little to something that does."&#xD;
"0 no, ma'am! it's not that!" Reuben said, raising his&#xD;
eyes to her face with the old earnest look. "But Miss&#xD;
Faith, there are some things one can't bear to hear said--&#xD;
and said so," he added a little lower, and looking down&#xD;
again. "And then-he's Dr. Harrison, and I'm only a&#xD;
poor boy and mayn't answer him--and that fretted me;&#xD;
and it isn't the first time, neither," Reuben said, as if he&#xD;
were making a clean breast of it. "Oh Miss Faith! I'd&#xD;
rather have had him knock me down, than speak such&#xD;
words !" Tears were getting the upper hand in the boy's&#xD;
voice.                  k&#xD;
"Dear Reuben," said Faith, very quietly, though her&#xD;
cheeks were two carnationsk-" what I am most sorry for is&#xD;
Dr. harrison."&#xD;
Reuben drew a long breath, with his "Yes, ma'am-1'na&#xD;
sorry for him too, very often--when he talks about other&#xD;
things. But I don't believe even you know just .-just&#xD;
how false that was." Reuben spoke as if the words choked&#xD;
him. "It's maybe never come in your way to know all he&#xD;
did here for everybody, and-for me."&#xD;
There was a quick pu1satio~m at that instant from Faith's&#xD;
heart to the hand that held her letter,--but she only said,.&#xD;
"Tell rae !"&#xD;
"I couldn't begin to tell you all, ~ Reuben said,&#xD;
a smile coming over his f1ace now,--" nobody could but&#xD;
himself--and he wouldn't remember. I couldn't even tell&#xD;
you all he's done for me; but one thing "--Reuben's eyes&#xD;
and voice fell and he spoke very low. "You know, Miss&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Faith, the rate of schooling here i~ fixed by the trustees.&#xD;
And the first day I came father told me to say he didn't&#xD;
know that he could find the money for more than one&#xD;
quarter, but he had so much all ready, and he wanted me&#xD;
to have so much. I thought it would be hard to ask, but&#xD;
it was so easy-of him," Reuben said with that same smile.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden didn't say much about it-only yes-but then&#xD;
he spoke to father (that very day we were at the shore Miss&#xD;
Faith) and told him I should come all the time-for the&#xD;
pleasure of teaching me." (Reuben thought the compel.&#xD;
inent went all to Mr. Linden, or he would not have told it.)&#xD;
"But father wouldn't do that,-he said Mr. Linden should&#xD;
have the money as fast as he could get it; and if he didn't&#xD;
take it I shouldn't come. And it was paid all the year,&#xD;
regularly. But then, Miss Faith-" there was a pause.&#xD;
"What, Reuben ?" she whispered.&#xD;
"Then instead of keeping it for himself, h~ put it all in&#xD;
the bank for me.-And If never knew it till I opened the&#xD;
letter he gave me when he was going away."&#xD;
The brightness of the hidden diamonds danced in Faith's&#xD;
face for a minute-half hidden too, but it was there.&#xD;
"Reuben," she whispered, as he was starting up to go,&#xD;
"what we have to do is to pray for Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"Miss Faith, how do people live who do not pray ?"&#xD;
"I don't know!"&#xD;
But Faith's voice did not speak the thanksgiving which&#xD;
bounded in her heart to Reuben's words. She sat back in&#xD;
her chair looking tired, with her letter clasped fast in her&#xD;
hand. Reuben stepped forward and arranged the fire softly&#xD;
-then giving her another wistful look he bowed and went&#xD;
lightly out of the room. With gentle step Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
came up to Faith, to kiss her and ask how she felt. Faith's&#xD;
eyelids enclosed.&#xD;
"Very happy, mother,-and tired too. Don't you think&#xD;
I could have a light presently ?"&#xD;
"This minute, pretty child. But lie down on the couch,&#xD;
Faith, and I'll bring up the little table."&#xD;
That was done, and then Faith read her letter, with first&#xD;
a rapid and then a slow enjoyment of it, making every word&#xD;
and sentence do more than double duty, and bring th every&#xD;
writer near. And then she lay with it clasped upon her&#xD;
&#xD;
boson', thinking those flowing trains of half feverish thought&#xD;
~hj~h are so full of images, but which in her case flowed&#xD;
with a clear stream over smooth channels, nor ever met a&#xD;
rough break or jar. Even Dr. Harrison did not make an&#xD;
exception, for Faith's thought of him was constantly soft-&#xD;
ened by her prayer for him. ;ller mother drew near when&#xD;
the letter was at last folded u~, and watched her from the&#xD;
other side of the stand; but though mind and heart too&#xD;
were full enough, she rightly judged that Faith needed no&#xD;
more excitement; and so never mentioned Dr. Harrison's&#xD;
name, nor even asked how he ~ime to carry off the rosebud.&#xD;
Faith's trains of thought ended at last in a sleep which&#xD;
lasted till past her tea-time. Mrs. Derrick was still by her&#xD;
side when she awoke, and Faith opening her eyes as quietly&#xD;
as she had shut them, remarked,&#xD;
"Mother 1-letters are great things."&#xD;
"Why child," said her mother smiling7 "what have you&#xD;
been dreaming about?"&#xD;
"Nothing..-That isn't a dream; it's a reality."&#xD;
Blessing in her heart the sender of the reality which gave&#xD;
such pleasure, Mrs. IQerrick answered, "Yes, child, it's real&#xD;
.-and so's he."&#xD;
Faith said nothing to that except by her smile. She&#xD;
only spoke the hope that she might be stronger the next&#xD;
day; a sentiment which though at first sight it might seem&#xD;
to have nothing to do with the former subject, was really in&#xD;
very close connexion with it.&#xD;
But Faith was not stronger the next day. The fever&#xD;
was not driven away and strength was in the grip of it yet.&#xD;
The doctor gave her no nexv directions, but insisted very&#xD;
much on quietness and care. There was nothing to be&#xD;
apprehended of the fever but tediousness, and the further&#xD;
and prolonged loss of strength; but that was quite enough&#xD;
to have to avoid. For that she must take all sorts of care.&#xD;
He also said that the c.~ise might go on without his over-&#xD;
sight for a day or two, and that for that space of time in&#xD;
the middle of the week he should be absent from Pattaquas-&#xD;
set, having a very urgent call of business elsewhere.&#xD;
And whether for that reason or needing. no fresh one, the&#xD;
doctor having stated so much went on to tell about other&#xD;
things, and made a long visit. The talk came upon the&#xD;

Bible again, Faith didn't know how, and grew very anj.&#xD;
mated. Dr. Harrison had brought with him this morning&#xD;
one of his pleasantest moods, or manners; he thought yes.&#xD;
terday that Faith's eyes bad given him a reproof for slander&#xD;
and he had no intent to offend in the like way again. lb&#xD;
was grave, gentle, candid, seemingly-willing to listen, b~&#xD;
that he always was to Faith; and talked sense or feeling&#xD;
in a most sensible and simple way. Yet the conversation&#xD;
ended with giving Faith great pain. He had asked her to&#xD;
read something confirmatory or illustrative of the statement&#xD;
she was making, out of the Bible; and Faith had complied&#xD;
with his wish. That was nothing strange. She had often&#xD;
done it. To-day the reading had been followed by a little&#xD;
observation, acutely put, which Faith felt raised a barrier&#xD;
between him and the truth she had been pressing. She felt&#xD;
it, and yet she could not answer him. She knew was&#xD;
false; she could see that his objection was foundationless&#xD;
-stood on air; but she did not see the path by which she&#xD;
might bring the doctor up to her standing-point where he&#xD;
might see it to6. It was as if she were at the top of a&#xD;
mountain and he at the bottom; her eye commanded a full&#xD;
wide view of the whole country, while his could see but a&#xD;
most imperfect portion. But to bring him up to her, Faith&#xD;
knew not.' It is hard, whbn feet are unwilling to climb!&#xD;
And unskilled in the subtleties of controversy, most inno-&#xD;
cent of the duplicities of unbelief, Faith saw her neighbour&#xD;
entangled, as it seemed, in a mesh of' his own weaving and&#xD;
had not power to untie the knot. It distressed her. Other&#xD;
knots of skepticism or ignorance that he had' presented to&#xD;
her she had cut easily with the sword of truth if she could&#xD;
'not untie; he had offered her one to-day that she could cut&#xD;
indeed as easily for herself,-.---but not for him. To do that&#xD;
called for not better wits, but for far greater controversial&#xD;
acumen and logical practice than Faith ~kuew. lie did&#xD;
not press his point, not even for victory; he gave the ob~&#xD;
section to her and left it there; but while to her it was&#xD;
mere rottenness of reasoning, she knew that for him it&#xD;
stood. It grieved ~her deeply; and Mrs. Derrick saw her&#xD;
worn and feverish all the day, without knowing what special&#xD;
reason there had been. She tried to stop Faith's working;&#xD;
but though not fit for it, Faith would not be stopped Sho&#xD;
&#xD;
~dared not trust Mr. Linden with any more excuses or put-&#xD;
~offs; and a feverish cheek and hand that day and the next&#xD;
went over her exercise and letter. And enjoyed both, in&#xD;
spite ~f fever. But when they were done, late in the next&#xD;
day, Faith lay down wearily on the couch and consoled&#xD;
herself with the thoughts of the letter to come; it was the&#xD;
evening for one.&#xD;
It was the evening for one and yet one came not. Other&#xD;
letters came-the great leather bag was tossed out on the&#xD;
statiQn-hOU5e steps, and thence borne off to the post-office,&#xD;
where five minutes later Reuben Taylor came to wait for&#xD;
his share of the contents. But when with the assurance&#xD;
which has never yet known disappointment, Reuben ap-&#xD;
plied at the window, Mintie gave him a rather coquettish-.&#xD;
"No, Mr. Taylor-you're not in luck to-day,-there's&#xD;
nothing for you."&#xD;
In his surprise Reuben tried every means to make him-&#xD;
~elC and her believe that she was mistaken; and urged a n~w&#xD;
~xainiuation of all the letters, till Mintie made-or feigned&#xD;
to make-it, with the same success.&#xD;
Reuben turned away from the office in real sorrow of&#xD;
~ieart. He had not now to learn what store was set by&#xD;
those letters-especially now, when Faith was siek,-he had&#xD;
noticed h~r holding of that very last one which had come.&#xD;
~nd then, not merely to lose the pleasure, but to have the&#xD;
iisappointment !.-.Then too, what had hindered the letter?&#xD;
)ne sometimes came out of time, but the expected one&#xD;
iad never yet failed. Was Mr. Linden sick ?-and what&#xD;
would Miss Faith think ?-the letter might fail from other&#xD;
~auses (hardly, Reuben thought) but what; would she&#xD;
~hink ?-.-herself so far from well. And then, should he go&#xD;
~t once and tell her-or let her find it out from his nou~&#xD;
appearance ?&#xD;
That last idea was promptly rejected, - she should at&#xD;
east not be in suspense, and Reuben was soon at her door,&#xD;
LS soon admitted. But he came in very quietly, without&#xD;
hat spring of step which had so often brought a letter, and&#xD;
standing by her chair said gently,-&#xD;
"Miss Faith, I didn't find anything to-night-but I&#xD;
thought I'd come and tell you, for fear you'd be cx-&#xD;

"Not find anyti~ing !"-said Faith raising herself half u~ Mr. Linden since she had. All these thoughts mingled,&#xD;
with the start of colour into her pale cheeks. but with them something else. They would tick on, those&#xD;

seemed to feel those minutes tracking with light steps across&#xD;

That day and the next were quiet days, being the days of weather-he might have met anybody or heard anything;&#xD;

Wednesday's letter, there was good hope of one Friday. Ai~d was a blank to him. What was the matter-how would&#xD;
as Friday wore away, Faith did not know that she was Miss Faith bear it-these two questions lay on his heart.&#xD;
counting the hours, and yet could at any time have answered In vain he tried to lay them down,-for the very words&#xD;
any question as to the time of day. It was one of those which told him that "the Lord doth not afflict willingly,"&#xD;
calm days, within doors and without, which ebb away so said also that he doth afflict; and Reuben's heart sank.&#xD;
noiselessly, that only the clock tells their progress. Faith's lie stood for a moment in the porch, realizing 'how people&#xD;
little clock-(Mr. Linden had amused himself with sending live who do pray'-then went in and straight upstairs,&#xD;
her one, about as big as a good-sized watch on a stand)-~ walked up to Faith's couch when admitted, and without&#xD;

&#xD;
Faith started up, with first a flush and then a great sinking&#xD;
of colour, and steadying herself with one hand on the back&#xD;
of the couch looked into her messenger's face as if there&#xD;
she could track the missing letter or discern the cause that&#xD;
kept it from her. But Reuben's face discovered nothing&#xD;
but his sorrow and sympathy; and Faith sank back on her&#xD;
pillow again with a face robbed of colour beyond all the&#xD;
power of fever's wasting to do.&#xD;
"Yes-write!" she said.&#xD;
Reuben stood still, his hands lightly clasped, his heart&#xD;
full of thoughts he had perhaps no right to utter, if he&#xD;
could have found words.&#xD;
"I wish you'd write, Reuben," she repeated after a moment,&#xD;
"Yes, ~ he said, "I will. Only-dear Miss Faith!&#xD;
you know 'the darkness and the light are both alike to Him.'"&#xD;
Reuben was gone.&#xD;
Faith lay for a few minutes as he had left her, and then&#xD;
slipped off the couch and kneeled beside it; for she felt as&#xD;
if the burden of the time could be borne only so. She laid&#xD;
her head and heart down together, and for a long time was&#xD;
very still; 'setting her foot on the lowest step' of some of&#xD;
those ladders, if she could not mount by them. A foot.&#xD;
hold is something.&#xD;
She was there yet, she had not stirred, when another foot.&#xD;
step in the passage and other fingers at the door made her&#xD;
know the approach of Dr. Harrison. Faith started up and&#xD;
met him standing. The doctor looked at her as he came&#xD;
up. So pale, so very quiet, so purely gentle, and yet with&#xD;
such soft strength in her eye,-he had not seen her look&#xD;
just so, nor anybody else, before.&#xD;
"How do you do?" he said reverentially as he took her hand.&#xD;
"I am-.-well,"-said Faith.&#xD;
"Are you ?" said the doctor gravely, eyeing the mark of&#xD;
unconquered fever and its wasting effects even on her then.&#xD;
-" I am very glad to hear it, indeed 1"&#xD;
"IL mean, that I feel-well," said Faith correcting herself.&#xD;
"You will feel better if you will take a more resting posi.&#xD;
tion," said the doctor putting her into the chair. And then&#xD;
he stood and looked at her; and Faith looked at her little&#xD;
clock, with her foot on that step of her 'ladder.'-" lie&#xD;
knoweth thy walking tlwough this great wilderness."&#xD;
&#xD;
"What have you been doing to yourself these two days ?"&#xD;
said the doctor.&#xD;
"Nothing-" she said ;.-" more than usual."&#xD;
lie laid her appearance all to the account of the fever,&#xD;
she was so quiet; and proceeded to a new examination&#xD;
of the state of her hand, and to give her various profes-&#xD;
sional orders.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, can you do anything in the way of eating ?"&#xD;
Her very face as well as her tongue seemed to answer&#xD;
him, "Not much."&#xD;
"Do you think of anything you c~uld fancy ?"&#xD;
"I brought some birds home with me that I believe I&#xD;
can answer for. Try to demolish~the pinion of one of them&#xD;
-will you? It is a duty you owe to society."&#xD;
"I will try,"-she said gravely.&#xD;
The doctor wondered whether she had laid up against&#xD;
him any of his former conversation.&#xD;
"What do you think," he said with a kind of gentle&#xD;
insinuation,-" of that argument I ventured to advance the&#xD;
other day, on the matter we were speaking of?"&#xD;
"1 don't like to think of it at all, Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"May I know why not?"&#xD;
"Because I know it is false, and yet IL cannot make you&#xD;
see it."&#xD;
"Can you make yourself see it ?"&#xD;
"I don't need to take any pains for that. I see it very&#xD;
well."&#xD;
"Perhaps you will find the way to make me see it," said&#xD;
the doctor pleasantly.&#xD;
"That would be easy," said Faith, "if__"&#xD;
"If what? May I not know the difficulty ?"&#xD;
"If you really cared about it."&#xD;
"I do care about it. You mistake me when you think&#xD;
that. But you must not think about anything now. Did&#xD;
you know I carried off your rosebud the other night ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
It was impossible to tell from the doctor's accept how he&#xD;
viewed the transaction, and equally impossible from Faith's&#xD;
answer to tell what she thought of it. Extremes meet-as&#xD;
Mr. Linden had once remarked.&#xD;

.244              SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'll endeavour to atone for that presumption to-morrow,"&#xD;
said he rising, for Mrs. Derrick now entered the room. To&#xD;
her Dr. Harrison repeated his orders and counsels, and to&#xD;
Faith's relief took himself away. her mother came tip to&#xD;
the easy-chair with a smothered sigh on her lips, and laid&#xD;
her gentle hand on Faith's forehead and wrist.&#xD;
"Child," she said, "has that man talked you into a fever&#xD;
again? I've a great mind not to let him come any more-~&#xD;
I guess I could cure you better myself. If you'd send word&#xD;
to somebody else, Faith, we'd have you well in no time."&#xD;
"I haven't heard from him to-night, mother." Faith felt&#xD;
the little start of her mother's hand.&#xD;
"Maybe he's coming then," said Mrs. Derrick, ~-"he&#xD;
might have meant to come yesterday and been hindered."&#xD;
Faith did not think that.&#xD;
"We shall know," she said to her mother. "We have&#xD;
only to wait and be quiet." And she carried out both parts&#xD;
of her stated duty to perfection.&#xD;
There is a strange sort of strength in a certain degree&#xD;
of weakness-or it may be that weakness runs sooner to its&#xD;
refuge, while strength stands outside to do battle with the&#xD;
evil felt or feared. Faith's gentle and firm temper was&#xD;
never apt for struggling, with either pain or fear; it would&#xD;
stand, or yield, as the case called for; and now, whether&#xD;
that her mind had been living in such a peaceful and loving&#xD;
atmosphere, both earthly and heavenly, that it could settle&#xD;
upon none but peaceful views of things, or that bodily&#xD;
weakness made her unable to bear a~iy other, she did mount&#xD;
upon one of those 'ladders' and left her burden on the&#xD;
ground. She thought she did. She was as quiet outwardly&#xD;
as before; she told Mrs. Derrick, who looked at her in&#xD;
misery,-and told her with a steady cheerful little smile,&#xD;
that "she dared say the letter would come to-morrow."&#xD;
But it is true that Faith had no power to eat that night nor&#xD;
the next day; and that she did not know the hidden slow&#xD;
fever-not of disease.-.-.which was ~running through all her&#xD;
veins and making the other fever do its work again, bright&#xD;
in iA1 cheek and eye and beating at her temples and wrist.&#xD;
But she was as still and quiet through it all-quiet in voice&#xD;
and brow-as if letters had been full and plenty.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
I T was about midday of Saturday, when Reuben Taylor,&#xD;
proceeding up the main street of Pattaquasset on&#xD;
some business errand for his father, was joined by Phil&#xD;
Davids-no wanted or F ourite associate or companion.&#xD;
But Phil now walked up the street alongside of the basket&#xD;
which had come "into town" with fish.&#xD;
"I say, Reuben," said Phil after some unimportant re-&#xD;
marks had been made and answered,~" does Mr. Linden&#xD;
ever write to you ?"&#xD;
Reuben started-as if that touched some under current&#xD;
of his thoughts, and answered "yes."&#xD;
"I wish he'd write to me," said Phil. "I know I 'd like&#xD;
it.I say, Taylor, what does he send you such thick letters&#xD;
about ?"&#xD;
"Such thick letters!" Reuben repeated, with a quick&#xD;
look at his companion. "People put a great many things&#xD;
in a letter, Phil."&#xD;
"I guess likely. That's what I say. What does he&#xD;
write to you about ?"&#xD;
"Maybe I'll bring up one of 'em for you to read,"&#xD;
said Reuben. "You've heard him talk, Phil-he writes&#xD;
just so."&#xD;
"Does he? I guess you wouldn't like to miss one of his&#xD;
letters then, Reuben,.-would you ?"&#xD;
"No."&#xD;
"I s'pose it would be a worse job yet to miss two of&#xD;
'em-wouldn't it ?" said Phil with a perfectly grave face.&#xD;
"Phil Davids !" Reuben exclaimed, facing round upon&#xD;
him, with such a flash of joy and hope and surprise and&#xD;
eagerness, as made Phil wonder. "What do you mean ?"&#xD;
he added checking himself. "Just turn your pockets inside&#xD;
out, Phil, before we go any further."&#xD;
"When were you ~t the poet ofti~co ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"Last night-and this morning." Reuben forced hiu~.&#xD;
self to be quiet.&#xD;
"Well look here,.-when you go there, don't you ask for&#xD;
letters ?"&#xD;
"Ask !-J've asked till they Were all out of patience."&#xD;
"Suppose you come to the right shop nGxt time !" said&#xD;
Phil, importantly producing the missing papers.&#xD;
"Phil! Phil !-" was all Reuben said. lie caught the&#xD;
letters-and stood looking at them with a face that made&#xD;
Phil look. "Mr. Linden ivill love you all his life for this,&#xD;
But how in the world did you get them ?"&#xD;
"That's exactly what I'd like somebody to tell rue !" said&#xD;
Phil. "I know who put the monkey's paw in the fire-hut&#xD;
how the chestnuts got there, I'm beat !"-&#xD;
"What do you kuow ?" said Reuben,-" where did you&#xD;
get these? Oh Phil! I never can thank you enough !"&#xD;
"It was because they were his letters I did it," said&#xD;
Phil bluntly. "I wasn't going to let Mintie Tuck have&#xD;
'em. But I say! Reuben, what have you done to spite&#xD;
her? or has she a spite against Mr. Linden? or who has&#xD;
she a spite against ?"&#xD;
"I don't know. Did she give 'em to you, Phil ?"&#xD;
"Not by a precious sight! nor to anybody else. Dromy&#xD;
saw 'em in her drawer, and for all the gumph he is, he&#xD;
knew the writing ;~ and I made him get 'em for me this&#xD;
morning while they were at breakfast. Now Taylor," said&#xD;
Phil, settling his hands farther down in his pockets as&#xD;
they rapidly walked along,-" what bird's on that nest ?"&#xD;
Reuben listened-with an intentness that spoke of more&#xD;
than wonder. "In her drawer ?" he repeated,-." what,&#xD;
down in the office ?"&#xD;
"Not a bit of it! Stowed sway with her earrings and&#xD;
ribbands upstairs somewhere."&#xD;
"Phil," 'said Reuben wh~n he had pondered this strange&#xD;
information in silence for a minute, "will you be in the&#xD;
office when the mail comes in for a night or two ?-and&#xD;
don't tell this to any one till Mr. Linden sends word what&#xD;
should be done."&#xD;
"You expect more letters ?" said Phil, with a not stupid&#xD;
glance at his fellow.&#xD;
"Yes," Reuben said, too frankly to increase suspicion;&#xD;
&#xD;
"and if one should come it's very important that I should&#xD;
get it. And of course I can't watch."&#xD;
"She sha'n't get it !" said Phil. "I'll be there. I'll be&#xD;
Siiibad's old man of the mountain for Mintie. I won't sit&#xD;
on her shoulders, but I'll sit on the counter; and if there's&#xD;
a scratch of Mr. Linden's in the mail-bag, I'll engage I'll&#xD;
see it as fast as she will. I know his seal too."&#xD;
"Ccndd she have done it to tease me ?" Reuben said,-&#xD;
"I've never had the least thing to do with her but through&#xD;
that post-office window."&#xD;
"What did you ever give her through the post~office&#xD;
window ?" Phil asked half laughingly.&#xD;
"Questions enough-" Reuben said, his thoughts too&#xD;
busy to notice~ any underhand meaning,-" and lately she's&#xD;
given me rather cross answers. That's all."&#xD;
"Well what do you suppose she stole your letters for ?"&#xD;
"I don't know enough about her to guess,~~ Reuben said&#xD;
frankly.&#xD;
"Well," said Phil, "I guess Dr. Harrison won't appoint&#xD;
the postmaster of Pattaquasset when I am President. I&#xD;
rather think he won't."&#xD;
"I wish you'd make haste and be President," Reuben&#xD;
said. "But if he didn't know anything about Mrs. Tuck,&#xD;
Phil, other people did-and thought she was honest at&#xD;
least. And you know she's postmaster, by right."&#xD;
"She-is the female of Dromy !" said Phil with intense&#xD;
expression. "But Mintie aint a fool, and it's she's post-&#xD;
master-anyhow Dromy says it's she that's Dr. Harrison's&#xD;
friend ;-so that makes it. But that don't tell why she&#xD;
wants the letters."&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison's friend ?" said Reuben,-" what does she&#xD;
have to do with him ?"&#xD;
"I aint a friend of either of 'em, so I don't know," said&#xD;
Phil. "But girls with pretty faces will make friends wit~i&#xD;
anybody !"&#xD;
A very high degree of masculine charity and correctness&#xD;
of judgment was expressed in Phil's voice and words.&#xD;
Reuben made no reply-his charity, of any sort, was not&#xD;
in a talkative mood, and the two parted ~kindly at Phil's&#xD;
cross road.&#xD;
Not home to dinner now, for Reuben! The minutes&#xD;

24~             SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
of talk had seemed long to his impatience; he had borne&#xD;
them, partly to get information, partly to keep down SUS-&#xD;
pieion. But now with Phil out of sight, he turned short&#xD;
about and took the way to Mrs~. Derrick's with almost ~y.&#xD;
ing steps. True, he was not dressed for "Miss Faith's"&#xD;
room-but Reuben Taylor was always neat and in order&#xD;
and she must not wait. He hurried into Mrs. Roscom's~&#xD;
there to leave his basket and every removable trace of his&#xD;
work,-then on!&#xD;
Faith had spent the early morning upon her couch ;-no&#xD;
need to ask if she felt stronger than yesterday,-every line&#xD;
and feature showed prostration-and patience. Breakfast&#xD;
had been passed over nominally. What Mrs. Derrick could&#xD;
do for her was done; what she could~ not, lay heavy on the&#xD;
hearts of both as the one went down to make the day's&#xD;
arrangements, and the other lay still to endure. Reuben&#xD;
had not come after the morning train-there was nothing&#xD;
even to expect till night, and Faith lay listening to her lit-&#xD;
tle clock and watching the passage of the April sunbeams&#xD;
through her room.&#xD;
Suddenly a loud startling rap at the front door. But&#xD;
she was powerless to go and see, ond after that one sound&#xD;
the house seemed to sink into perfect stillness. Then the&#xD;
door of her room opened, and Mrs. Derrick came in bear-&#xD;
ing a large basket. A heavy one too, but Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
would have spent her last atom of strength before she&#xD;
would have let any one else bring it up. Her face looked&#xD;
quite radiant.&#xD;
"Pretty child !" she said, "here's something for you !"&#xD;
It 'was needless to% ask questions,.-Mrs. Derrick's face&#xD;
could have but one meaning. Faith neither asked nor an-&#xD;
swered, except by the sudden start of the blood into cheeks&#xD;
which were pale enough before. Slipping from thecouch&#xD;
she was on her knees by the basket, pulling out the ends&#xD;
of the knots by which it was tied, with just a tiny beauti-&#xD;
ful smile at work on her changed lips. Her mother went&#xD;
softly away (she thought the first sight of anything in that&#xD;
line belonged to Faith alone) and the April sunbeams took&#xD;
a new view' of things.&#xD;
The knots gave way, and the basket cover swung round~&#xD;
and the white wrapping paper came off; and within lay&#xD;
&#xD;
50mething for her truly ! ----most appropriate! A great&#xD;
stein of bananas and another of plantains, thick set with&#xD;
fruit, displayed their smooth green and red coats in very ex-&#xD;
cellent contrast, and below and around and doing duty as&#xD;
mere packing, were sunny Havana oranges, of extra size,&#xD;
and of extra flavour-to judge by the perfume. But bet-&#xD;
ter than all, to Faith's eye, was a little slip of black-&#xD;
marked white paper, tucked under a red banana-it had&#xD;
only these words.-&#xD;
"'Sweets to the sweet.'&#xD;
Faith, I should put in more, but the basket refuses. it&#xD;
is the measure of only one part of the proverb-do you&#xD;
understand ?"&#xD;
Faith knew oranges, she had never 'seen bananas or&#xD;
plantains before. It was all one; for the time being they&#xD;
were not bananas or oranges but hieroglyphics; and the&#xD;
one fruit looked as much, like Mr. Linden's handwriting as&#xD;
the other. She sat with her arm resting on the couch sup~&#xD;
porting her head, and looking at them. Not the finest&#xD;
picture that Goethe ever viewed1 or bade his friends view&#xD;
as part of their "duty," was so beautiful as that basket of&#xD;
red and yellow fruit to Faith's eye. And all the more for&#xD;
that foreign look they were like Mr. Linden; for the com-&#xD;
mon things which they said, it was like him to say uncom-&#xD;
monly. How very sweet was the smell of those oranges!&#xD;
and how delicious the soft feeling of peace which settled&#xD;
down on all Faith's senses. Very different from the sort&#xD;
of quiet she was in a quarter of an hour ago. She did not&#xD;
trouble herself now about the missing letters. This told&#xD;
that Mr. Linden was well, or he could hardly have been&#xD;
out to buy fruit and pack it and pack it off to her. So&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick found her-reading not words, but oranges and&#xD;
bananas; with a face it was a pity Mr. Linden could not see.&#xD;
It may be remarked in passing that the face was not lost&#xD;
upon the one who did see it. Mrs. Derrick came and&#xD;
stooped down by Faith and her basket in great admiration&#xD;
and joy and silence for a moment-the sight almost put&#xD;
everything else out of her head; but the~i she exclaimed,&#xD;
"Child, the doctor's coming !-I saw him driving up to&#xD;
the door."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
250             SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
Faith put the cover on the basket, and while Mrs. Der.&#xD;
rick set it out of sight, she received the doctor as yesterday,&#xD;
standing. But with a nice little colour in her cheeks to.&#xD;
day, in place of yesterday's sad want of it. Dr. Harrison&#xD;
came up with one hand full df a most rare and elegant&#xD;
bunch of hothouse flowers.&#xD;
"My amends-making---" he said as he presented it.&#xD;
It was not in Faith's nature not to look pleasure and&#xD;
admiration at such bits of kindred nature. They were&#xD;
very exquisite, they were some of them new to her, they&#xD;
were all most lovely, and Faith's eyes looked love at them.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison was satisfied, for in those eyes there was to.&#xD;
day no shadow at all. Their gravity he was accustomed&#xD;
to, and thought he liked.&#xD;
"How do you do ?" he said.&#xD;
"I am-a great deal better. 0 mother-may I have a&#xD;
glass of water for these ?"&#xD;
"You said yesterday you were well, Miss Faith."&#xD;
"You saw I wasn't," said Faith as she put her flowers&#xD;
in the glass.&#xD;
"That is very true. And I see also that your statement&#xD;
to-day is not of much juster correctness. How came you&#xD;
to say that ?"&#xD;
"I said it without knowing-what I said," Faith an~&#xD;
sweJ~ed simply. "What is this, Dr. Harrison ?"&#xD;
e doctor puzzled over her answer and could make&#xD;
nothing of it.&#xD;
'~ That is a Fuchsia-and that is another."&#xD;
"How beautiful !-how beautiful. They are not sweet ?"&#xD;
~'You cannot always have sweetness in connexion with&#xD;
everything else," he said with a slight emphasis.. Faith's&#xD;
n4nd was too far away from the subject to catch his&#xD;
innuendo; unless other lips had spoken it.&#xD;
"Mrs. Derrick," said the doctor, "I should like as~a&#xD;
professional man, to know what portion of the wing of a&#xD;
robin this lady can manage for her breakfast ?"&#xD;
"Some days more and some days ~less," said Mrs. Der~&#xD;
rick. "She was not very hungry this morning." (A mild&#xD;
statement of the case.)&#xD;
"$ome days less than the wing of a robin !" said the&#xD;
&#xD;
doctor. "The robin himself is a better feeder. Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick, what fancies does this bird live upon ?"&#xD;
The allusion drew a smile to Faith's face, which Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick did not understand.&#xD;
"She don't tell all her fancies,-.-she has seemed to live&#xD;
on tea and toast, for eatables."&#xD;
The doctor smiled, and went back to Faith who was&#xD;
busy with the flowers; or as Mrs. Derrick said, seemed to&#xD;
be busy with them.&#xD;
"Are those better than cowslips ?" he asked lightly.&#xD;
"They are more wonderfully beautiful-they are not&#xD;
better in their place."&#xD;
"How is that ?"&#xD;
"I told you cowslips were bits of spring," said Faith&#xD;
smiling. "These are not that. I think everything in the&#xD;
world.-I mean, the natural world-has its place, that it fills."&#xD;
"Better than any other would ?"&#xD;
"I suppose so. Yes."&#xD;
"That is admirable philosophy," said the doctor. "Ex-&#xD;
cellent to keep one contented. Three feet of snow is then&#xD;
as good as May zephyrs! Daisies and dandelions are fair&#xD;
substitutes for geraniums and cacti! And these barren&#xD;
granite fields, where the skeleton rock has hardly covered&#xD;
itself skin deep with soil, are better than flowery prairies&#xD;
of rolling land, and fertile wilderne~ses of roses !"&#xD;
"Well," said Faith; "you needn't laugh. I think they&#xD;
are."&#xD;
"By what transmutation of philosophy ?"&#xD;
Faith's philosophy was put to the test by certain sounds&#xD;
which just then came to her ear; the hall door opened and&#xD;
shut quick though softly, and Reuben came lightly upstairs&#xD;
-two stairs at a time !-but his knock at Faith's door was&#xD;
almost as quiet as usual. Whatever spirit of energy was&#xD;
at work in him, however, calmed itself down at sight of&#xD;
Dr. Harrison-whom he did not then stay to greet; but&#xD;
coming up with a swift steady step to Faith's chair, knelt&#xD;
down there and gave her his hand with, "Miss Faith, are&#xD;
you better to-day ?"&#xD;
If a rosebud yesterday shut up in the cold had opened&#xD;
all its beams to the sun,..-that was Faith to-day, as she&#xD;
took Reuben's hand and held it.&#xD;

&#xD;
"That is a very devoted servant of yours, Miss Faith"&#xD;
said the doctor pointedly. "I notice he gives you homage&#xD;
in true chivalric style. Does the transmuting philosophy&#xD;
extend thus far also ?"&#xD;
Faith turned the light of her face upon him as she an.&#xD;
swerved, "I shouldn't be worthy of one of those knights or&#xD;
of this, Dr. Harrison, if I would change one for the other."&#xD;
Reuben had risen to his feet as the doctor spoke, and as&#xD;
he quitted Faith's hand laid his own, with the slightest pos.&#xD;
sible gesture, upon the left breast of his coat; which did&#xD;
not mean (as it would with Sam Stoutenburgh) that there&#xD;
was his heart-but that there were the letters! Then step.&#xD;
ping back with a bow acknowledging Dr. Harrison's pre.&#xD;
sence, Reuben went over to the window to speak to Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick. The doctor had seen him before that morning&#xD;
from the window, aswith some ordered fish Reuben entered&#xD;
Judge Harrison's gate, and his dress was the same now as&#xD;
then,-how the different offices could be so different and so&#xD;
reconciled-or what this office was, were matters of study.&#xD;
But clearly Faith was as strong for her knight as her. knight&#xD;
was for her.&#xD;
"I didn't understand the transmuting philosophy in the&#xD;
former case," the doctor remarked.&#xD;
"It is not that," said Faith with rising colour, for she&#xD;
had seen Reuben's hand gesture. "It is just taking things&#xD;
as they are."&#xD;
"That is a philosophy deeper than that of transmuta.&#xD;
tion P' said the doctor. "I give it up. But what is the&#xD;
philosophy y in this case ?-" and he nodded slightly towards&#xD;
Reuben.&#xD;
"If you ever know him, you'll know, Dr. Harrison,"&#xD;
Faith said softly.&#xD;
"Is he so trustworthy ?" said the doctor thoughtfully&#xD;
looking at him; but then he gave his attention to Faith,&#xD;
and talked of herself and what she was to do for herself;&#xD;
until seeing no prospect of the doctor's being out of his&#xD;
way, Reuben was again passing them on his way out. The&#xD;
doctor arrested him by a slight but pleasant gesture.&#xD;
"What are you doing now, Taylor ?"&#xD;
"Nothing new, sir,--a little for my father and a little for&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
&#xD;
L~J saw you doing something for your father, I think&#xD;
to.day. Doesn't that hinder your studies ?"&#xD;
"Mr. Linden used to say that one duty never really&#xD;
hinders another, sir.&#xD;
"Pleasant doctrine !" said the doctor. "I am tempted&#xD;
to try it now. If you bestow a little time upon me, it will&#xD;
not perhaps interfere with your going to dinner afterwards.&#xD;
Poes Mr. Linden continue to hold some of his super-&#xD;
vision over you? Do you hear from him sometimes ?"&#xD;
"Yes sir.-both,"~--was Reuben's prompt answer.&#xD;
"Then you have something to do with the post-office&#xD;
occasionally ?"&#xD;
"Yes sir."&#xD;
"And know pretty well w~hat everybody in Pattaquasset&#xD;
says of every other body,-don't you ?"&#xD;
"I don't need to go to the post-office for that, sir,"&#xD;
Reuben siUd quietly.&#xD;
"No-I mean by virtues of another office-~--that which&#xD;
you exercise for your father. But it is true, isn't it ?"&#xD;
"Not quite, sir. Some people do not talk to me-and&#xD;
some I never stop to hear."&#xD;
The doctor smiled a little, along with an acute look of&#xD;
approving intelligence.&#xD;
"Well-do you happen to know what is said or thought&#xD;
of the people I was the means of putting into the post-&#xD;
office, half a year ago?"&#xD;
"Not very well, sir. I haven't heard much said about&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"As far as yo4r knowledge goes, they seem to be doing&#xD;
their duty ?"&#xD;
"I make no complaint, sir."&#xD;
Dr. Harrison glanced at Faith with a not pleased expres-&#xD;
sion, and back again. "Does that mean that you have&#xD;
none to make, or that you will make none? I am asking,&#xD;
you surely must know, not officially nor judicially; but to&#xD;
gain private information which it is desirable I should&#xD;
have; and which I ask, and expect to receive, confiden-&#xD;
tially."&#xD;
"Sir," Reuben said gravely, though with a manner per-&#xD;
fectly respectful, "why do you ask me ~ The gentlemen of&#xD;
Pattaquasset should know more about their own post~office,&#xD;

&#xD;
than the p fishers of Quapaw. There is a clannishnes5&#xD;
among p r people, sir,-if I had heard~nything, I sho~&#xD;
not like t tell you."&#xD;
The doctor got up and took his old position on the car.&#xD;
pet rug, a very slight air of haughty displeasure mixing&#xD;
with his habitual indolent gracefulness.&#xD;
"This is your knight, Miss Derrick! Apparently the&#xD;
proverb of 'friends' friex~ds' does not hold good with&#xD;
him. When you are a little older, sir, you will kflOW-....jf&#xD;
you grow correspondingly wiser-that the fishers of Qua.&#xD;
paw or of any other point are precisely the people to know&#xD;
in such a matter what the gentlemen whom it more nearly&#xD;
concerns, cannot get at; and you have yourself given the&#xD;
reason."&#xD;
Faith looked at Reuben with a little inquiring wonder,&#xD;
But he made no answer, either to her look or the doctor's&#xD;
words; indeed perhaps did not see the former, for his own&#xD;
eyes were cast down. He stood there, the fingers of both&#xD;
hands lightly interlaced, his face quiet to the last degree of&#xD;
immovability. The doctor's first words, to Faith, had&#xD;
brought a moment's flush to his cheeks, but it had passed.&#xD;
with the moment; gravity and steadiness and truth were all&#xD;
that remained. The doctor recognized them all, but all as&#xD;
adverse or opposition forces.&#xD;
"I will not detain you longer, sir !-I told you, Miss&#xD;
Faith," he said sitting down and changing his tone, "that&#xD;
I did not know how to cut up cake - still less how to&#xD;
administer it. I found this family-very poor-over at&#xD;
Neanticut, on some of my excursions ; - and somewhat&#xD;
carelessly thought they could perform the duty of taking&#xD;
papers out of a bag, as well as wiser people. There is a&#xD;
girl too, the daughter, who seemed clever enough. But I&#xD;
have had reason to doubt my own wisdom in the proceed-&#xD;
ing, after all."&#xD;
Faith heard the door close after Reuben with the first of&#xD;
the doctor's words to her. She listened to tl~e rest with a&#xD;
divided interest. Her mind had gone off to her basket of&#xD;
bananas, and was besides occupied with a little lurking&#xD;
wonder at Reuben's impracticability. But with nothing&#xD;
strongly, the feeling of weakness and lassitude was so&#xD;
taking the upper hand of every other. The relaxing now&#xD;
&#xD;
began to tell of the great tension she had borne for a day&#xD;
or two; the relaxing was entire, for wh~,t the basket had&#xD;
begun Reuben's appearance had finished. Faith was sure&#xD;
he had a letter for her, and so sat and looked at the doctor&#xD;
like one whose senses were floating away in a dream-one&#xD;
of those pleasant dreams that they do not wish to break.&#xD;
"You are faint !" said the doctor suddenly. "Mrs.&#xD;
Perrick, have you any wine in the house? I should like&#xD;
some here."&#xD;
But Mrs. Derrick's first step (it seemed but that) was to&#xD;
Faith-taking her out of the easy-chair and putting her on&#xD;
the couch before any one had time to say ay or no. Thde&#xD;
she left her while she opened the closet and got out the&#xD;
wine; bringing it then to iFaith and setting the doctor&#xD;
aside most unceremoniously. Faith had not quite reached&#xD;
the fainting point, though she was near it from mere inani~&#xD;
tion. She drank the wine, and smiled at them both like&#xD;
one who had a secret wine of her own that she was taking&#xD;
privately.&#xD;
"What will she eat, Mrs. derrick ?" said the doctor in&#xD;
real concern. "Tea and toa t won't do !"&#xD;
"I will take something presently," Faith said with&#xD;
another of those childlike satisfied looks. They made&#xD;
Dr. Harrison very unlike hi self, always. He stood so&#xD;
now.&#xD;
"Doctor," said Mrs. Der ick, in her odd, free, rather&#xD;
blunt and yet kindly way, " on are a very good doctor, I&#xD;
dare say, but you're not mu h of a nurse. Now I am-&#xD;
and I'll find her something to eat, - you needn't be&#xD;
uneasy."&#xD;
He looked at her with one of the best smiles that ever&#xD;
came over his face; right, ree and kindly ~ then turned&#xD;
to Faith.&#xD;
"What made your knight o cross with me ?" he said as&#xD;
he bent over her to take her and.&#xD;
"I don't know-.-" said Fa th. "I am sure he had some&#xD;

&#xD;
The doctor was inclined to be of a different opinion, for&#xD;
his brows knit as soon as he had closed her door.&#xD;
Now mother I" said Faith half raising herself,.-.." please&#xD;
let me have my basket. I am going to try one of those&#xD;
queer things. That is what I want.?'&#xD;
"Do you know what I want ?" satd Mrs. Derrick as she&#xD;
brought up the basket. "Just to have Dr. Harrison find&#xD;
Mr. Linden here some day !" Which severe sentence was&#xD;
so much softened down by the weight of the basket, that it&#xD;
sounded quite harmless.&#xD;
Faith was too eager to get the cover off to pay present&#xD;
attention to this speech. There they were again! the red&#xD;
and yellow strange, beautiful, foreign-looking things which&#xD;
she was to eat; too handsome to disturb. But finally a red&#xD;
plump banana was cut from the stem, and Faith looked at&#xD;
it in her fingers, uncertainThow to begin the attack. Look.&#xD;
ing back to the little empty space where it had been, Faith&#xD;
became 'ware' of an end of blue ribband beneath said&#xD;
space. Down went the banana and down went Faith. The&#xD;
loop of ribband being' pulled gently suggested that it was&#xD;
not able to contend with an unknown weight of bananas;&#xD;
but when Faith partly held these up, the ribband yielded to&#xD;
persuasion, and tugged after it into the daylight a tiny&#xD;
package-which being unwrapped revealed a tiny oval case;&#xD;
wherein lay, last of all, a delicate silver knife. Faith's face&#xD;
of overflowing delight it was good to see.&#xD;
"0 mother !-.-how just like him !-~.Mother !" exclaimed&#xD;
Faith,--." this is to eat those with I"&#xD;
Could anything more be wanting to give bananas a fla.&#xD;
your? They happened moreover to hit the fancy the doctor&#xD;
had been so anxious to suit. Faith liked her first one very&#xD;
much, and pronounced it very nearly the best of all' fruits.&#xD;
But being persuaded to try one, Mrs. Derrick avowed that&#xD;
she could not eat it and wondered how Faith could; declare.&#xD;
ing that in her judgment if a thing was sweet at all, it ought&#xD;
to be sweeter.&#xD;
If Dr. Harrison could have seen the atmosphere of peace&#xD;
and delight his knit brows had left behind them!&#xD;
As soon as he was gone, Reuben brought up the letters.&#xD;
And with sunshine all round her, Faith read them and went&#xD;
to sleep, which she did with the little case that held her&#xD;
&#xD;
kui'e clamped in her hand. Sleep claimed her while fever&#xD;
took its turn and passed away for the day. Faith woke up&#xD;
towards evening, weak and weary in body, unable ton3ake&#xD;
,nu~h lively shew of the 'merry heart' which 'doeth good&#xD;
like a medicine'.&#xD;
"My studies don't get on very fast at this rate, mother,"&#xD;
she remarked as she sat in the easy-chair at her tea, unable&#xD;
to hold her head up.&#xD;
"This has been a hard day,~" her mother said sadly as she&#xD;
looked at her. "'Faith, I w~n't let Dr. Harrison pay any&#xD;
more such long visits! he tires you to death."&#xD;
"It wasn't that. Mother-I think i'll have one of those&#xD;
things out of my basket-I wish Mr. Linden h~d told me&#xD;
what to call them."&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick brought the basket and looked on intently.&#xD;
"When is he coming, child ?" she said.&#xD;
Faith did not certainly know. Under the influence of a&#xD;
plantain and the silver knife she revived a little.&#xD;
"Mother-what made you wish Dr. Harrison might meet&#xD;
Mr. Linden here ?"&#xD;
"It would save him a world of trouble," said Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick kindly. "And besides, child, I'm tired seeing him buzz&#xD;
round you, myself. Faith, Mr. Linden would say that he&#xD;
ought to be told you're sick."&#xD;
"I can judge for him once in a while" Faith said with a&#xD;
little bit of a triumphing smile.&#xD;
"Well-" said her mother,-" you'll see what he'll say.&#xD;
I guess he'd rather you'd judge for him about something&#xD;
else."&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
F AITH Tallied somewhat from the prostration that suc-&#xD;
ceeded those days of anxiety; but then the fever&#xD;
again asserted its empire, and strength, little b~ little but&#xD;
daily, lost ground rather than gained it. Though not ever&#xD;
very high, the fever came back with persevering regularity;&#xD;
it would not be baffled; and such always recurring assaults&#xD;
are trying to flesh and blood and to spirit too, bethey of&#xD;
what they may. Faith's patience and happy quiet never&#xD;
left her; as the weeks went on it did happen that the&#xD;
quiet grew more quiet, and was even a little bordering&#xD;
on depression. One or two things helped this uncom.&#xD;
fortably.&#xD;
The sense of the extreme unpleasantness of such a meet-&#xD;
ing as her mother had wished for, perhaps startled Faith&#xD;
to a fresh sense of what she had to do in the premises,&#xD;
She resolved to be as grave and cool as it was possible to&#xD;
be, in Dr. Harrison's presence. She would keep him at&#xD;
such a distance as should wean him from any thoughts of&#xD;
her. Faith tried faithfully to do what she had purposed.&#xD;
But it was very difficult to keep at a distance a person who&#xD;
did not pretend to be near, or only pretended it in a line&#xD;
where he could not be repulsed. He must see her every&#xD;
day as her physician. He must be allowed the kindly ex-&#xD;
pression of kind feelings; he could not be forbidden to&#xD;
bring to his patient, as her friend and physician, such&#xD;
things as he thought her strength, or weakness, needed.&#xD;
These instances of thoughtfulness and care for her were&#xD;
many. Birds, old wine from his father's cellar, flowers&#xD;
from the greenhouse, and fruit from nobody knows where,&#xD;
came often; and the manner of offering them, the quiet,&#xD;
unobtrusive, unexacting kindness and attention, it was&#xD;
scarce possible to reject without something that would&#xD;
have seemed churlishness. Faith took them as gravely as&#xD;
she could without being unkind. Her illness helped her,&#xD;
and also hindered the effect she wished to produce. Feel-&#xD;
ing weak and weary and unable for any sort of exertion, it&#xD;
(268)&#xD;
&#xD;
waS the easier for 1~er to be silent, abstracted, unresponsive&#xD;
to anything that was said or done. And also her being so&#xD;
signified the less and testified the less of her rcal purpose.&#xD;
Faith knew it and could not help it. She could not besides&#xD;
be anything but natural; and she felt kindly towards Dr.&#xD;
Harrison; with a grave kindness, that yet was more earnest&#xD;
in its ~good wishes for him than any other perhaps that&#xD;
existed for Dr. Harrison in the xvorld. Faith could not&#xD;
hide that, careful as she was in her manner of showing it.&#xD;
And there was one subject upon which she dared not be&#xD;
unresponsive or abstractted when the doctor brought it up.&#xD;
He brought it up now very often.&#xD;
She did not know how it was, she was far from knowing&#xD;
why it was; but the pleasant talk with which the doctor&#xD;
sought to amuse her, and which was most skilfully pleasant&#xD;
as to the rest, was very apt to glance upon Bible subjects;&#xD;
and as it touched, to brush them with the wing of doubt-&#xD;
or difficulty- or uneasiness. Dr. Harrison did not see&#xD;
things as she did-that was of old; but he contrived to&#xD;
let her see that he doubted she did not see them right, and&#xD;
somehow contrived also to make her hear his reasons. It&#xD;
was done with the art of a master and the steady aim of a&#xD;
general who has a great field to win. Faith did not want&#xD;
to hear his suggestions of doubt and cavil. She remem-&#xD;
bered Mr. Linden's advice long ago given; repeated it to&#xD;
herself every day; and sought to meet Dr. Harrison only&#xD;
with the sling stone of truth and let his weapons of artifi-&#xD;
cial warfare alone. Truly she "had not proved these," and&#xD;
dlcould not go with them." But whatever effect her sling&#xD;
might have upon him, which she knew not, his arrows were&#xD;
so cunningly thrown that they wounded her. Not in her&#xD;
belief; she never failed for a moment to be aware that they&#xD;
were arrows from a false quiver, that the sword of tnuth&#xD;
would break with a blow. And yet, in her weak state of&#xD;
body and consequent weak state of mind, the sight of such&#xD;
poisoned arrows flying about distressed her; the mere&#xD;
knowledge that they did fly and bore death with them; a&#xD;
knowledge which once she happily had not. All this wotild&#xD;
have l)ained her if she had been well; in the feverish de-&#xD;
pression of illness it weighed upon her like a mountain of&#xD;
cloud. Faith's shield caught the darts and kept them from&#xD;

&#xD;
herself; but in her increasing nervous weakness her hand&#xD;
at last grew weary; and it seemed to Faith then as if she&#xD;
could see nothing but those arrows flying through the air.&#xD;
But there was one human form before which, she knew, this&#xD;
mental array of enemies would incontinently take flight anc~&#xD;
disappear; she knew they would not stand the first sound of&#xD;
Mr. Linden's voice; and her longing grew intense for his&#xD;
coining. How did she ever keel) it out of her letters! Yet&#xD;
ft hardly got in there, for she watched it well. Sometimes&#xD;
the subdued "I want to see you very much,".-at the close&#xD;
of a letter, said more than Faith knew it did; and she&#xD;
could not be aware how much was told by the tone of her&#xD;
writing. That had changed, though that too was guarded,&#xD;
so far as she could. She could not pour out a light, free,&#xD;
and joyous account of all that was going on within and&#xD;
about her, when she was suffering alternately from fever&#xD;
and weakness, and through both from depression and nerv.&#xD;
osis fancies. Most unlike Faith! and she tried to seem her&#xD;
usual self then when she came most near it, in writing to&#xD;
him. But it was a nice matter to 'write letters for so many&#xD;
weeks out of a sick room and not let Mr. Linden find out&#xD;
that she herself was there all the while. His letters how.&#xD;
ever were both a help and a spur; Faith talked a good&#xD;
deal of things not at Pattactuasset; and through all weak.&#xD;
ness and ailing sent her exercises prepared with utmost&#xD;
care, regularly as usual. It hurt her; but Faith would&#xD;
not be stopped. Her sickness she knew after all was but a&#xD;
light matter; and nothing could persuade her to break in&#xD;
upon Mr. Linden's terni of study with any more interrupt.&#xD;
tions for her. And 'even to Mrs. Derrick she did not tell&#xD;
the keen heart-longing, which daily grew more urgent, for&#xD;
that term to come to an end.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick did sometimes connect the cause of her&#xD;
weariness with Dr. Harrison, and was indignant in proper.&#xD;
tion. Faith looked at him with different eyes, and her&#xD;
feeling was of very gentle and deep sorrow for him. It&#xD;
was by the appeal to that side of her character that Dr.&#xD;
Harrison gained all his advantage.&#xD;
Faith's shield caught his arrows of unbelieving sugges-&#xD;
tion and threw them off from her, own heart; she could&#xD;
not put that shield between them and the doctor, and that&#xD;
&#xD;
was her grief It grieved her more than he thought. And&#xD;
yet, it was with a half conscious7 half instinctive availing&#xD;
himself of this feeling that he aimed and managed his at-&#xD;
tacks with such consummate tact and skill. Faith would not&#xD;
have entered into controversy; she would not have taken up&#xD;
a gauntlet of challenge; did he know that? His hints and&#xD;
questions were brought into the subject, Faith knew not&#xD;
how; but the point of view in which they always presented&#xD;
themselves was as troubles of his own mind-difficulties&#xD;
he would willingly have solved-questions he would like to&#xD;
see answered. And Faith's words, few or many, for she&#xD;
was sometimes drawn on, were said in the humble yearning&#xD;
desire to let him know what she rejoiced in and save him&#xD;
from an abyss of false fathomless depth. It was more than&#xD;
she could do. Dr. Harrison's subtle difficulties and propo-&#xD;
sitions had been contrived in a school of which she knew&#xD;
nothing; and were far too subtle and complicate in their&#xD;
false wit for Faith's true wit to answer.' Not at all for&#xD;
lack of wit, but for lack of skill in fencing and of experi-&#xD;
ence in the winding of duplicity. So she heard things&#xD;
that grieved her and that she could not shew up to the&#xD;
doctor for what she knew them to be.&#xD;
"I am no better than this little knife !" she thought&#xD;
bitterly one day, as she was looking at her favourite silver&#xD;
banana-carver;-" it can go through soft fruit well enough,&#xD;
but it isn't strong enough or sharp enough to deal with&#xD;
anything harder !-"&#xD;
Faith did herself injustice. It takes sometimes little less&#xD;
than Ithuriel's spear to make the low, insidious, unobtrusive&#xD;
forms of evil stand up and shew themselves what they are&#xD;
...-the very Devil!&#xD;
"Reuben," said Faith one time when they were alone&#xD;
together,-" did you ever hear any of the mischievous talk&#xD;
against the Bible, of people who don't love it ?"&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Faith,-J never heard a great deal at a&#xD;
time-only little bits nc~w and then. And I've felt some-&#xD;
times from a word or two what other words the people had&#xD;
in their hearts."&#xD;
"Don't ever let people talk it to you~ Reuben, unless&#xD;
God makes it your duty to hear it," she said wearily.&#xD;
Reuben looked at her.&#xD;

"Do you think he ever makes it our duty, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"I don't know !" said Faith, a little as if the question&#xD;
startled her. "But you might be where you could not help&#xD;
it, Reuben."&#xD;
He was silent, looking ~rather thoughtfully into the fire,&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he said, "you remember when Christian&#xD;
was going through the Valley of the Shadow of Deat1~&#xD;
the fiends came and whispered to him all sorts of dreadful&#xD;
things which he would not have thought of for the world,&#xD;
'But,' as Mr. Bunyan says, 'he had not the discretion&#xD;
either to stop his ears, or to know from whence those bias.&#xD;
phemies came'." Reuben blushed a little at his own advice.&#xD;
giving, but made no other apology.&#xD;
There was much love and respect and delight in Faith's&#xD;
swift look at him. Her words glanced. "Reuben7 I an~&#xD;
glad you are going to be a minister !"-..She added with th~&#xD;
sorrowful kw~k stealing over her face, "X wish the worN~&#xD;
was full of ministers l---if they were good ones."&#xD;
His face was very bright and grateful, and humble too.&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he said, taking up her words, "don't you&#xD;
love to think of that other definition of minister ?..-.-you&#xD;
know-..-.' ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure'."&#xD;
"In that way the world is full now," said Faith; "in ~di&#xD;
things except men. But by and by 'the great trumpet will&#xD;
be blown' and 'they that were ready to perish' shall come,&#xD;
from everywhere. It's good to know that."&#xD;
"It's such a beautiful thing to know, just by believing 1"&#xD;
Reuben said,-." don't you think so, Miss Faith? And then&#xD;
whatever people say or do, and if we can't find a word to&#xD;
answer them, we know down in our hearts, that the Bible&#xD;
is true. And so 'by faith we stand'."&#xD;
~~ButAWe ought to find words to answer them, Reuben-&#xD;
or else, though we stand, they fall I"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am-sometimes," Reuben said rather hesita-&#xD;
tingly. "Only-I've heard Mr. Linden say that a Chris.&#xD;
tian must take care of his own standing first, and do&#xD;
nothing to shake that; or else he may have his own light&#xD;
blown out while he's trying to light other people's. You&#xD;
know, Miss Faith, the five wise virgins would not give&#xD;
their oil to the others. I've heard Mr. Linden talk about&#xD;
it very often," Reuben added softly, as if he wanted to&#xD;
screen himself from the charge of presumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
If Faith was bringing charges, it was against herself&#xD;
for she sat very silent and thoughtful, and weary also; for&#xD;
when for the fifth or sixth time Reuben brought his eyes&#xD;
from the fire to her face he saw that she had fallen asleep.&#xD;
Mr. Linden's letters about this time told two or three&#xD;
things, among the rest that he might soon be looked for&#xD;
instead of letters. Moreover that he felt sure he was&#xD;
wanted-and further, that Faith's letters had changed.&#xD;
These two last things were not said in words, but Faith&#xD;
read them none the less surely-..read thus first that her let-&#xD;
ters really were different. Just what cause Mr. Linden&#xD;
assigned to himself, she did not know, nor whether he had&#xD;
fixed upon any; but it was clear that nothing but the fact&#xD;
that his freedom was so close at hand, kept him from free-&#xD;
ing himself at once and coming to Pattaquasset. And&#xD;
second only to Faith did Mrs. Derrick long for his appear-&#xD;
ance.&#xD;
She had heard bits of the doctor's talk from time to&#xD;
time, but for a while with some doubt of their meaning,.-.-.&#xD;
as whether he was reporting what other people said, or&#xD;
whether she had heard him correctly. But when by&#xD;
degrees the goodness of her hearing attested itself, then&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick's indignation began to follow suit. The&#xD;
doctor's object she did not at first guess (perhaps made&#xD;
it, if possible, worse than it was) but that made little&#xD;
difference.&#xD;
On this particular afternoon, when Faith woke up she&#xD;
fouiid Reuben gone and her mother keeping watch. The&#xD;
fair look that always greeted Mrs. Derrick was given her,&#xD;
but otherwise the face she was studying was not satisfac-&#xD;
tory. The roundness o~ the cheek was much lessened, the&#xD;
colour was gone, and the lines of expression were weary&#xD;
though she had slept. Or rather perhaps they were too&#xD;
gravely drawn.&#xD;
"Faith," said her mother decisively, "you want your tea.&#xD;
Can you eat a broiled pigeon, if I broil it myself?"&#xD;
"I can eat a piece of one, if you'll take the rest,&#xD;
mother," she said with a smile at her. "I eat a whole&#xD;
banana just before J went to"&#xD;
"Well this ain't the doctor's pigeon, so I guess it will&#xD;
be good," said Mrs. Derrick. "Sam Stoutenburgh brought&#xD;

it..-And I'm going to cook it here, pretty child, because ~&#xD;
want to be here myself. I suppose the smoke won't tron.&#xD;
ble you if it goes up chimney ?"&#xD;
"I'd like it, smoke and all, mother,'~said Faith, changing&#xD;
the resting-place for her head. "But you needn't slight&#xD;
the doctor's birds-they were as fine birds as could be.....&#xD;
when I could eat them."&#xD;
"'Birds of a feather'.-." said Mrs. Derrick laconically&#xD;
And she drew out some of the glowing and Winking&#xD;
embers, and set thereon the tiny gridiron with its purplish&#xD;
plump pigeon. "Sam's home now, Faith, and you'd think&#xD;
he'd been through every degree of everything. But the&#xD;
first thing he did was to go off and shoot pigeons for you."&#xD;
Faith was inclined to think he had not got above one&#xD;
degree. She sat in her easy-chair and watched the play&#xD;
cookery with amused pleased eyes.&#xD;
I should like to be in the kitchen again, mother-..doing&#xD;
something for you."&#xD;
"You shall do something for me presently," said her&#xD;
mother, as the pigeon began to send out little puffs of&#xD;
steam and jets of juice, which the coals resented. "This&#xD;
one's fat, anyway-and there's a half dozen more. The&#xD;
fun of it is, child, that Sam was afraid there weren't&#xD;
enough !.-he wanted to know if I was sure they'd last till&#xD;
to-morrow !.-.so I guess he's not in a fainting away state.&#xD;
I told him we'd roast beef in the house, for you to fall&#xD;
back upon, child," she added with a little laugh, as she&#xD;
turned the pigeon. But her face wa~ very grave the next&#xD;
moment, with the sorrowful reality. "Pretty child," she&#xD;
said tenderly, "do you feel as if you could eat a muffin or&#xD;
a biscuit best ?"&#xD;
"Mother, that pigeon is making me hungry, it smells so&#xD;
nice. I am sure I can cat anything'"&#xD;
"Well I ~ made muffins," said Mrs. Derrick7 bustling&#xD;
softly about with the little table and the tea-things. "Faith,&#xD;
I'm afraid to have Mr. Linden come home and find your&#xD;
cheeks so thin."&#xD;
"I'm not," said Faith quietly.&#xD;
"My !" said her mother, "you never were afraid of any*&#xD;
thing he'd a mind to do, child. But for all I know, he may&#xD;
carry you off to Europe in the next steamer. He's up&#xD;

&#xD;
265&#xD;
&#xD;
to 'roost anything," said Mrs. Derrick stooping down by&#xD;
the pigeon, and giving it the persuasion of a few more coals.&#xD;
Faith said languidly that she did not think there was&#xD;
much danger, and Mrs. Derrick for the present concentrated&#xD;
her attention upon the tea preparations. Cindy came up&#xD;
~jth a little teakettle, and Mrs. Derrick made the tea, and&#xD;
then went down stairs to superintend the first baking of the&#xD;
muffins, leaving the teakettle to sing Faith into a very quiet&#xD;
state of mind. Then presently reappearing, with a smoking&#xD;
plate of cakes in her hand, Mrs. Derrick took up the&#xD;
pigeon, with due applications of butter and salt and pepper,&#xD;
and the tea was ready. It was early; the sunbeams were&#xD;
lingering yet in the room, the air wafted in through the&#xD;
window the sweet dewy breath of flowers and buds and&#xD;
springing grass over the pigeon and muffins; and by Faith's&#xD;
plate stood the freshest of watercresses in a little white&#xD;
bowl. These Reuben brought her every day, wet from the&#xD;
clear stream where they grew, shining with the drops of&#xD;
bright water, and generally sprinkled too with some of the&#xD;
spring flowers. To-day the plate on which the bowl stood&#xD;
had a perfect wreath or crown of mouse-ear,---..the pale pink&#xD;
blossoms saying all sorts of sweet things. The room was&#xD;
well off for flowers in other respects. Dr. Harrison's hot-&#xD;
house foreigners looked dainty and splendid, and Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh's periwinkle and crocuses and daffodils looked&#xD;
springlike and fresh; while in another glass a rich assort-&#xD;
ment of dandelions spoke a prettier message yet, frora&#xD;
Charles twelfth and his little cotnpeers.&#xD;
"And the mouse-ear is come !" said Faith as she applied&#xD;
herself to the refreshment of salt and watercresses. "I won-&#xD;
der whether Reuben does this becarise he loves flowers him-&#xD;
self, or because he knows I d~o. I guess it's both. How&#xD;
lovely they are! how my dairy must want me, mother."&#xD;
Which was said with a little recollective patient sigh.&#xD;
"I guess it can wait," said her mother cheerfully. "And&#xD;
I guess it'll have to. You needn't think yo~i'll be let do&#xD;
anything for one while, Faith."&#xD;
"I guess I shall, mother. I am sure I ~am stronger to-&#xD;
day,-and Dr. Harrison said I had less fever. And your&#xD;
pigeon is good. Besides, I must,-.--~if I can,".-.-said Faith&#xD;
with an anticipative glance this time.&#xD;

"It's my belief, child,"' said her mother, "that If Dr&#xD;
Harrison had staid away altogether or never staid here&#xD;
more than five minutes at a time, you'd have been better&#xD;
long ago. But I think you are better-in spite of him."&#xD;
Of the two subjects Faith preferred the pigeon to Dr.~&#xD;
Harrison, and discussed it quite to her mother's satisfaction,&#xD;
But if silent, she thought never the less. Both Reuben&#xD;
Taylor's words and her mother's words quickened her to&#xD;
thinking, and thinking seemed of very little use. The next&#xD;
day when the doctor came she was as grave and still and&#xD;
unresponsive as she could be. And it had no effect on hint&#xD;
whatever. He was just as usual, he talked just as usual;&#xD;
and Faith could but be grieved~ and be silent. It did not&#xD;
enter her gentle imagination that the very things which so&#xD;
troubled her were spoken on purpose to trouble her. flow&#xD;
could it? when they made their way intQ the conversation&#xD;
and into her hearing as followers of something else, as&#xD;
harpies that worried or had worried somebody else, as&#xD;
shapes that a cloud might take and be a cloud again-only&#xD;
she could not forget that shape. It was near now the time&#xD;
for Mr. Linden to come home, and Faith looked for his&#xD;
coming with an hourly breath of longing. It seemed to&#xD;
her that his very being there would at once break the mesh&#xD;
Dr. Harrison was so busy weaving and in which she had no&#xD;
power to stop him.&#xD;
But the doctor's opportunity for playing this game was&#xD;
nearing an end, and he knew it. He did not know that&#xD;
Mr. Linden was coming; he did know that Faith was&#xD;
getting well.&#xD;
A day or two after the talk with Reuben it happened&#xD;
that Mrs. Derrick was detained down stairs when the doc.&#xD;
tor came up to see Faith. The room was full of a May&#xD;
warmth and sweetness from the open windows ; and Faith&#xD;
herself in a white dress instead of the brown wrapper,&#xD;
looked May-like enough. Not so jocund and blooming&#xD;
certainly; she was more like a snowdrop than a crocus.&#xD;
Her cheeks were pale and thin, but their colour was fresh;&#xD;
and her eye had the light of returning health,- or of&#xD;
returning something else!&#xD;
"You are getting well, !" said the doctor. "I shall lose&#xD;
my' work-.and forgive me, my pleasure !"&#xD;
&#xD;
uj will give you some better work to do, Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"What is that? Anything for you! "&#xD;
"Jt is not for me. That little lame child to whom you&#xD;
sent the rose-tree, Dr. Harrison, -she i~ very sjck. Would&#xD;
you go and see her ?"&#xD;
"Did you think I would not ?" he said rather gravely.&#xD;
"I want to see her very much myself," Faith went on ;...-..&#xD;
"but I suppose I could not take so long a ride yet.&#xD;
Could I ?"&#xD;
The doctor looked at her.&#xD;
"I think the mother of the Gracehi must have been&#xD;
something such a woman 1" he said with an indescribable&#xD;
grave comic mien ;-" and the other Roman mother that&#xD;
saved Rome and lost her son! Or that lady of Sparta&#xD;
who made the affectionate request to her son about coming&#xD;
home from the battle on his shield! I thought the race had&#xD;
died out."&#xD;
Faith could not help laughing. He had not been sure&#xD;
that she would understand his allusions, but his watchful&#xD;
eye saw that she did.&#xD;
"Were you educated in Pattaquasset ?" he said. "Par-&#xD;
don me 1"-&#xD;
All Faith's gravity returned, and all her colour too.&#xD;
"No, sir," she said, "I have never been educated. I am&#xD;
studying now."&#xD;
"Studying 1" ~said he gently. "You have little' need to&#xD;
study."&#xD;
"Why, sir?"&#xD;
"There are minds and natures so rich by their original&#xD;
constitution, that their own free growth is a fuller and better&#xD;
harvest than all the schoolmasters in the world can bring&#xD;
out of other people."&#xD;
Again Faith's cheek was dyed. "I was poor enough,"&#xD;
she said bowing her head for a moment. "I am poor now,&#xD;
-but I am studying."&#xD;
In which last words lay perhaps the tiniest evidence of&#xD;
an intention not to be poor always. A suspicious glance&#xD;
of thought shot from the doctor's mind. But as it had&#xD;
happened more than once before, the simplicity of Faith's&#xD;
frankness misled him, ~and he dismissed suspicion.&#xD;
' if you want an illustration of my meaning,~~ he went on&#xD;

"The Rhododendron does all it can."&#xD;
"Well-" said the doctor,-."it is impossible to trace the&#xD;
limits of the influence~ of mignonette."&#xD;
Faith looked grave. She was thinking how very power.&#xD;
less her influences had been.&#xD;
"Don't you see that I have made out my position ?"&#xD;
"What sort of studying-may I ask it ?-do you favour&#xD;
most ?" he said with a smile.&#xD;
"I like all kinds-every kind !"&#xD;
"I believe that. I know you have a love for chynPstry,&#xD;
and Shakspeare, and natural history. But I should like to&#xD;
know Mignonette's favourite atmosphere."&#xD;
"The study I like best of all is the one you like least,&#xD;
Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"What may that be, Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"The study of the Bible."&#xD;
"The Bible! Surely you know that already," he said in&#xD;
an interested voice.&#xD;
"Did you think so ?" said Faith quickly and with secret&#xD;
humbleness. "You made a great mistake, Dr. Harrison.&#xD;
But there is nothing I take such deep lessons in ;-nor such&#xD;
pleasant ones."&#xD;
"You mistake me too, Miss Faith. I do like it. You&#xD;
are strong enough for it to-day-I wish you would give Inc&#xD;
one of those lessons you speak of?"&#xD;
"If you loved it, sir, you would not ask me. You would&#xD;
find them for yourself."&#xD;
"Another mistake !" said the doctor. "I might love&#xD;
them, and yet ask you. Won't you give me one ?"&#xD;
She lifted to his a look so gentle and grave that he could&#xD;
not think she was displeased, or harsh, or even unkind.&#xD;
But she answered him, "No."&#xD;
"Don't you feel strong enough for it ?" he said with a&#xD;
shade of concern.&#xD;
"Yes.".&#xD;
"You t1~ink you have given me one lesson already," he&#xD;
said smiling, "which I am not attending to. I will go and&#xD;

can't find her by the sign of the rosebush ?"&#xD;
"Reuben Taylor will take you there, Dr. Harrison, if&#xD;
von will let him. He goes there often."&#xD;
"If I will let him ! Say, if he will let me! Your knight&#xD;
does not smile upon me, Miss Faith."&#xD;
"Why not ?"&#xD;
"I'm sure I'm not qualiaed to give evidence," said the&#xD;
doctor hail' laughing at having the tables turned upon him.&#xD;
"Unless his chivalric devotion to you is jealous of every&#xD;
other approach - even mine~ But you say he will guide&#xD;
me to the rosebush ?"&#xD;
"I am sure he will ~vith great pleasure, Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
" d I will go with great pleasure-for you."&#xD;
He was standing before her, looking down. There was&#xD;
something in the look that made Faith's coJo~ur come again.&#xD;
She answeredseriously, "No sir-not for mb."&#xD;
"Why not?"&#xD;
"I can't reward you," said Faith; trembling, for she&#xD;
felt she was speaking to the point. "Do it for a better&#xD;
reason."&#xD;
"Will you shew me a better?"&#xD;
She answered instantly with a bright little smile, "'Give,&#xD;
and it shall be given unto you; full measure, pressed down,&#xD;
heaped up, and running over, shall men give into your&#xD;
bosom.'"&#xD;
"In another world !-" said the doctor.&#xD;
"No-in this. The promise stands for it."&#xD;
"It's your part of this world-not mine; and unless you&#xD;
shew me the way, Miss Faith, I shall never get into it."-&#xD;
Then more gently, taking her hand and kissing it, he added,&#xD;
"Are you tired of trying to help me&#xD;
Faith met his keen eye, reddened, and drooped her head;&#xD;
for indeed she felt weak. And her words were low and&#xD;
scarce steady. "I will not be tired of praying for you, Dr.&#xD;
harrison."&#xD;
What swift electric current along the chain of associa-&#xD;
tion moved the doctor's next question. He was silent a&#xD;
minute before he spoke it; then spoke in a clear even&#xD;
voice. "May II ~s1~ you-Is it impertinent - what first led&#xD;

you to this way of thinking ?-Sophy says you were not&#xD;
always so."&#xD;
The colour deepened on Faith's cheek, he saw that, anc~&#xD;
deepened more.&#xD;
"The teaching is always of heaven, sir. But it came to&#xD;
me through the hands of the friend who was so long in our&#xD;
house-last year."&#xD;
"And has that adventurer counselled you to trust no&#xD;
friend that isn't of his way of thinking ?" the doctor said&#xD;
with some haughtiness of accent.&#xD;
Faith raised her eyes and looked at him the steady grave&#xD;
look that the doctor never liked to meet from those soft,&#xD;
eyes. It fixed his, till her eyes fell with a sudden motion&#xD;
and the doctor's followed them-whither? To that gloved&#xD;
forefinger which he had often noticed was kept covered.&#xD;
Faith was slowly drawing the covering off; and something&#xD;
in her manner or her look kept his eyes rivetted there.&#xD;
Slowly, deliberately, Faith uncovered the finger, and in full&#xD;
view the brilliant sparkled ~ danced and leapt, as it seemed&#xD;
to Faith, whose eyes saw nothing else. She did not dare&#xD;
look up, nor could, for a double reason. She sat like a fair&#xD;
statue, looking still and only at the diamond sign, while th~&#xD;
blood in her cheeks that bore witness to it seemed the only&#xD;
moving thing about her. That rose and deepened, from&#xD;
crimson to scarlet, and from her cheeks to the rim of her&#xD;
hair.&#xD;
She never saw the changes in her neighbour's face, nor&#xD;
what struggles tha paleness and the returning flush bore&#xD;
witness to: She never looked up6 She had revealed all;&#xD;
she was willing he should conceal all,-that~ he could. It&#xD;
was but a minute or two, though Faith's measurement made&#xD;
it ~a more indefinite time; and Dr. Harrison took her hand&#xD;
again, precisely in his usual manner, remarked that it was&#xD;
possible he might be obliged to go south in a day or two&#xD;
for a day or two, but that he rather thought he had cured&#xD;
her; and so went off, with no difference of tone that any.&#xD;
stranger could have told, and Faith never raised her eyes&#xD;
to see how he looked.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXi.&#xD;
R. HARRISON sent away his curricle and walked&#xD;
~home,-slowly, with his hands behind him, as if the&#xD;
May air had made him lazy. To any one that met him, he&#xD;
wore as disengaged an air as usual; his eye was as coolly&#xD;
cognizant of all upon which it fell, and his brow never&#xD;
looked less thoughtful. While his head never had been&#xD;
more busy. He kept the secret of his pride-he had kept&#xD;
and would keep it, well; no one should guess what he bore;&#xD;
but he bore a writhing brain and a passion that was heav-&#xD;
ing with disappointment. To no end-except to expose&#xD;
himself-he had worked at his mining operations all these&#xD;
months; nothing could be more absolute than the silence&#xD;
of Faith's answer; nothing could be more certain than the&#xD;
fixedness of her position. A against the very impassable-&#xD;
ness of the barrier the doctor's will chafed, even ~vhule his&#xD;
hope gave way. He ruthlessly called himself a fool for it&#xD;
too, at the minute. But he was unused to be baffled; and&#xD;
no man pursues long with such deliberate energy a purpose&#xD;
upon which he has set his heart, without having all the&#xD;
cords of his will and his passion knit at last into a cable of&#xD;
strength and tenacity. The doctor's walk grew slower, and~&#xD;
his eyes fell on the ground. How lovely Faith had looked&#xD;
-even then, when she was putting him and herself to pain;&#xD;
how speakingly the crimson hues had chased each other&#xD;
all over her face, and neck; how shyly her eyelashes had&#xD;
kept their place on her cheek; with how exquisite grace&#xD;
her still attitude had been maintained. And ~withal what&#xD;
a piece of simplicity she was! What a cQntrast those&#xD;
superb diamonds had made with the almost quaint un-&#xD;
adornedness of her figure in its white wrapper. A con-&#xD;
trast that somehow was not inharmonio~, and with which&#xD;
the doctor's artistic taste confessed itself bewitched, though&#xD;
Faith's only other remotest ornament was that very&#xD;

womanly one of her rich brown hair. A piece of simplicity?&#xD;
Could she be beyond his reach? With duty between,.....&#xD;
yes; otherwise,-no! as all the doctor's experience told&#xD;
him. And he walked leisurely past his own door, past the&#xD;
houses of the village, on almost to the entrance of the&#xD;
woody road; then turned and came with a brisker pace&#xD;
back. lie still called himself a fool, secretly; but he went&#xD;
into the library and wrote a letter. Which in course of&#xD;
time was received and read by Mr. Linden between two of&#xD;
his pieces of work.&#xD;
It appeared the next day that Dr. Harrison had changed&#xD;
his mind, or his* plans, about going south; for he came as&#xD;
usual to see Faith. In every sense as usual; to her&#xD;
astonishment no traces remained of the yesterday's conveiL&#xD;
station. The ease and kindliness of his manner had suffered&#xD;
no abatement, although a little touch of regretfulness, just&#xD;
allowed to appear, forbade her to doubt that she had been&#xD;
understood. Spite of herself, she could not help being&#xD;
presently again almost at ease with him. Nevertheless&#xD;
Faith wished he had gone south.&#xD;
She did not feel sure that Mr. Linden would be pleased&#xD;
with the state of matters, as days went on, and she~as&#xD;
sure she~ was not pleased herself. There ~r~s something&#xD;
she did not understand. The doctor's manner was not pre.&#xD;
suing, in a way; neither did he obtrude even his sorrow&#xD;
upon her; yet he took the place of a privileged person-&#xD;
she felt that - and she was obliged t~o see his pain in the&#xD;
very silence and in the play of words or of face which she&#xD;
thought assumed to conceal it. She was very sorry for&#xD;
him, and in the same breath thought she must have been&#xD;
wrong in something, though she could not see how, or&#xD;
things would never have come to such a point;&#xD;
She could not guess-how could she !-that the doctor&#xD;
was playing a desperate game and had thrown his last&#xD;
stake on the chance of a flaw in Mr. Linden's confidence&#xD;
towards her or in hers towards him, or of a flaw in the tem~&#xD;
per of either of them, or a flaw in their pride, or affection!&#xD;
There are flaws in so many characters! Did but either of&#xD;
them lack moral courage, or truth, or trust, or common&#xD;
sense, like a great many of the rest of the world-and the&#xD;
doctor had gained his ground! For Dr. Harrison had de~&#xD;
&#xD;
termined that Faith's religious opinions should not stand in&#xD;
his way; she should think as he did, or-he would think&#xD;
~jth her!&#xD;
Of all this Faith knew nothing. She had only an intui-&#xD;
tive sense that something was not right; and doubt and&#xD;
annoyance kept her strength back. She lost ground again.&#xD;
All summed itself up in a longing for Mr. Linden to come.&#xD;
Meanwhile Mr. Linden had received and read the follow-&#xD;
ing despatch, and studied and taught before and after it as&#xD;
best he might.&#xD;

"MY DEAR LINDEN,&#xD;
I do not know what impulse prompts me to write this&#xD;
letter to you.-A very strong one, probably, that makes&#xD;
fools of men-Yet even with my eyes open to this, I go on.&#xD;
I have unwittingly become, your rival. Not in fact,&#xD;
indeed, but in character. I have been so unfortunate as to&#xD;
love a person you are somehow concerned in-and before&#xD;
I knew that you had any concern of the kind. That is a&#xD;
very simple story7 and only one to be smothered-not to be&#xD;
brought to open air,--were it all. But the course of the&#xD;
months past, which has too late brought me this knowledge&#xD;
of myself, has also made me believe that-had I. a fair&#xD;
field-were th re no contrary ties or fetters of conscience-&#xD;
I should not love in vain. What those ties are I know&#xD;
nothing - I have not asked-but the existence of some&#xD;
obligation I have been given to understand. With certain&#xD;
natures of truth and duty, that is a barrier impassable. You&#xD;
would be safe, were I to act out of honour.&#xD;
I am a fool, I believe; but I am not yet such a fool as&#xD;
no to know that there is but one man in the world to whom&#xD;
I coul vrite such a confession. Nothing better prompts&#xD;
it than pure selfishness, I am aware-but with me that is&#xD;
strong. I have that notion of you that you would not&#xD;
care to keep what you held only by priority of claim. I&#xD;
may be wrong in the supposition upon which I am going-&#xD;
yet it is my chance for life and I. cannot yield it up. That&#xD;
were the lady free-in conscience as well as in fact-she&#xD;
might be induced to look favourably on me. I ought to&#xD;
add, that I believe such a consciousness has never shaped&#xD;
itself to her mind-the innocence with which she may at&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
milE spring opened from day to day, and the apple&#xD;
I&#xD;
~ blossoms were bursting. Mr. Linden might soon be&#xD;
looked for, and one warm May afternoon Faith went in&#xD;
to make his ro6m ready. It was the first day she had&#xD;
been fit for it, and she was yet so little strong that she&#xD;
niust take care of her movements. With slow and unable&#xD;
fingers she did her pleasant work, and then very tired, sat&#xD;
down in her old reading window-seat and went into a long&#xD;
dream-meditation. It was pleasant for a while, in har-&#xD;
mony with the summer air and the robins in the maple; it&#xD;
got round at last into the train of the last weeks. A&#xD;
fruitless reverie ended in Faith's getting very weary; and&#xD;
she went back to her own room to put herself on the couch&#xD;
cushions and go to sleep.                          )&#xD;
Sleep held on its way after a peaceful fashion, yet not so&#xD;
but that Faith's face showed traces of her thoughts. Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick came softly and watched her, and the spring air&#xD;
blew back the curtains and fanned her, and brushed her&#xD;
hair with its perfumed wings; and one or two honey bees&#xD;
buzzed in and sought honey from the doctor's flowers, and&#xD;
forsook them again for the fields.&#xD;
Up there at last, following Mrs. Derrick, came Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den. With few reasons asked or told of his sudden appear-&#xD;
ance; with little said even of Faith's illness but the mere&#xD;
fact, he went up to the sunlit room and there staid. Not&#xD;
restingly in Faith's easy-chair, but standing by the low fire-&#xD;
place, just where he could have the fullest view of her.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick came and went, -he never stirred. The sun-&#xD;
beams came and went-wrapped Faith in their bright folds&#xD;
and lay at his feet, then began to withdraw altogether.&#xD;
They had showed hini the unwontedly pale and worn face,&#xD;
and lit up the weary lines in which the lips lay asleep; and&#xD;
just when the sunbeams had left it all, Mr. Linden became&#xD;
aware that two dark eyes had softly opened and were&#xD;
gazing at him as if he were ~a figure in a dream. So per-&#xD;

haps for a minute he seemed, touched with the light as he&#xD;
was, which made a glorification in the brown locks of his&#xD;
hair and gleamed about "pleasant outline~" standing as&#xD;
fixed and still as a statue. But they wc~re not statue eyes&#xD;
which looked into hers, and Faith's dreas~like gaze ~&#xD;
only for a moment. Then every line of her face changed&#xD;
with joy, and she sprang up to hide it in Mr. Linden'8&#xD;
arms. lie stood still, holding her as one holds so~&#xD;
rescued thing. iF7or Faith was too weak to be just herself&#xD;
and weariness and gladness had found their own very ~&#xD;
usual expression in an outflow of nervous tears.&#xD;
Something seemed to have taken away Mr. Linden~&#xD;
power of words. He did place her among the cushions&#xD;
again, but if every one of her tears had been balm to hin&#xD;
he could not have let them flow more unchecked. Perhaps&#xD;
the recollection that they were tears came suddenly; for&#xD;
with very sudden sweet peremptoriness he said,&#xD;
"Faith, hush !-Are you so glad to see me ?"&#xD;
She was instantly ~til1. No answer.&#xD;
"What then ?" The intonation ~vas most tender,-so,&#xD;
rather than by any playfulness, cancelling 4ils own question,&#xD;
She raised her head, she had dismissed her tears, yet the&#xD;
smile with which her glance favoured him was a sort of&#xD;
rainbow smile, born of clouds.&#xD;
"That is a very struggling and misty sunbeam !" said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "Is that why I was kept out of its range so&#xD;
long ?"&#xD;
Faith's head drooped. Her forehead lay lightly against&#xD;
him; he could not see what sort of a smile she wore.&#xD;
"Whereupon it goes into seclusion altogether. Mignon.&#xD;
ette, look up and kiss me,.-.-how much longer do you sup.&#xD;
pose I can wait for that ?"&#xD;
He had no longer to wait at that time, and the touch of&#xD;
her lips was with a tremulous gladness which was tale..te11~&#xD;
ing. And then the position of the lowered head and the&#xD;
hand which kept its, place on his shoulder showed him that&#xD;
she was clinging, though with shy eagerness, like a bird&#xD;
the.t with tired wing ha~ found her nest. With one of those&#xD;
quick impulses whh~h to-day seemed to have taken the place&#xD;
of his usual steadiness, Mr. Linden bent down and lAessed&#xD;
her; in words such as she never remembered from other&#xD;

&#xD;
lips. Not many indeed, but deep and strong, ..-as the very&#xD;
depth and strength of his own human and religious nature;&#xD;
words that stilled Faith's heart as with the shadowing of&#xD;
peace; so that for the time she could not wonder, but only&#xD;
rest. They made her tremble a moment; then she rested&#xD;
as if the words had been a spell. But the rest wrought&#xD;
action. Faith drew back presently a\~id looked up at Mr.&#xD;
Linden to see how he looked. And then she could not&#xD;
tell. Her puzzled eyes found nothing to remark upon.&#xD;
"Endy-I thought you would not be here for two or&#xD;
three days yet."&#xD;
"It was nearly impossible. My child, when did you get&#xD;
sick ?"&#xD;
"0-a good while ago."&#xD;
"'A good while'," - Mr. Linden repeated with grave&#xD;
emphasis. "Well do you think it would have lengthened&#xD;
the time to have me come and see you ?"&#xD;
Faith's heart was too full, and her answer, looking down,&#xD;
was a tremulous, quiet and tender,&#xD;
"I don't think it would."&#xD;
"Then wherefore was I not permitted ?"&#xD;
"I didn't want you to come then."&#xD;
"And again, wherefore ?"&#xD;
"Why you know, Endy. I couldn't want you till you&#xD;
were ready to come."&#xD;
"I should have been most emphatically ready! What&#xD;
sort of medical attendance have you had ?"&#xD;
"Good, you know. I had Dr. Harrison."&#xD;
"And he did his duty faithfully ?"&#xD;
"I guess he always does-his medical duty," said Faith&#xD;
somewhat quietly.&#xD;
"Duty is a sort of whole-souled thing, to my mind," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "Do you think all his ministrations did you.&#xD;
good?"&#xD;
There was pain and wonder, and even some fear in Faith's&#xD;
eyes as she looked at Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"They ought not to have done me any harm" she said&#xD;
meekly.&#xD;
"Did they, Faith? I thought-" Very softly and thought-&#xD;
fully his fingers came about her hair, his eyes looking at&#xD;
her, Faith could hardly tell how. The pain of those weeks&#xD;

stung her again.-.-.the sorrow and the shame and the need.&#xD;
lessness. Faith's head sunk again upon Mr. Linden's&#xD;
breast, for the tears came bitterly; though he could not&#xD;
k~1ow that. He only knew that they came. Holding her&#xD;
with a strong arm-as if against some one else; soothing&#xD;
'her with grave kisses, not with words, Mr. Linden waited&#xD;
for her to speak.&#xD;
"Child," he said at last, "you will do yourself harm,&#xD;
Has he brought on this state of 'the nerves that he talks&#xD;
about? And in what possible way ?"&#xD;
"Don't talk about it, Endy !-~" said Faith struggling&#xD;
for self-command-" I am foolish-and wrong-and weak,&#xD;
I'll tell you another time."-But Faith's head kept its&#xD;
position.&#xD;
"Do you think I can wait, to know what has made my&#xD;
coming home such a tearful affair ?"&#xD;
"Yes. Because it's all over now."&#xD;
"What is over ?"&#xD;
"All-that you wouldn't like."&#xD;
"Faith you talk in perfect riddles !-.-Jt is well that what&#xD;
I can see of this very pale little face is less puzzling. Did&#xD;

"What ?-." she said looking up.&#xD;
"Well.-You know what that claim is. Did you tel)&#xD;
him, Faith ?"&#xD;
Her eyes fell again. "Yes-at least-I she wed him my&#xD;
ring."&#xD;
" In answer to his suit, Faith ?"&#xD;
"No.-He was talking as I did not like, one day."-.&#xD;
Faith's cheeks were growing beautifully rosy.&#xD;
"Was it to protect yourself; or me ?" said Mr. Linden&#xD;
watching her. Faith's glaiice up and down, was inex-&#xD;
pressibly pretty.&#xD;
"Myself; I think."&#xD;
"You have a strange power of exciting and keeping&#xD;
down my temper, at one and the same time I" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden. "What did he dare say to you ?"&#xD;
"Nothing about me. It was something-about you-.&#xD;
which I did not choose to have him say."&#xD;
Mr. Linden smiled, and called her a little crusader, but&#xD;
the grave look came back. Dr. Harrison had known,&#xD;
&#xD;
then, just what ties he was trying to break,-had felt sure&#xD;
....-rnust have felt sure-~-that they were bonds of very deep&#xD;
Jove and confidence; and thereupon, had coolly set him-&#xD;
self to sow mistrust! Mr. Linden was very sllent,.-tlie&#xD;
keen words of indignation that rose to his lips ever driven&#xD;
back and turned aside by Faith's face, which told so plainly&#xD;
that she coyild bear no excitement. He spoke at last with&#xD;
great deliberation.&#xD;
"You may as well shew it to all Pattaquasset, Mig-&#xD;
nonette !-for all Pattaquasset shall know before I have&#xD;
been here much longer."&#xD;
"What ?-why ?" she said startling.&#xD;
"For what you will, love. I think you need the pro-&#xD;
tection of my name."&#xD;
Faith could not deny it; however she looked quaintly&#xD;
grave upon the proposition.&#xD;
"Do you know how you will have to scour the country&#xD;
now, and make yourself as much as possible like cowslips&#xD;
and buttercups and primroses and mouse-ear ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden smiling. "One day you may be a Spring beauty,&#xD;
and the next Meadow~sweet, and when I see you a wild&#xD;
pink I shall feel comparatively happy."&#xD;
Faith with a very little laugh remarked that she did not&#xD;
feel as if she ever should be anything wild.&#xD;
"What is your definition of wild ?"&#xD;
"Not tame."&#xD;
"Does that meek adjective express the kind of pink you&#xD;
intend to be ?"&#xD;
"I didn't say what I should be-I only spoke of what&#xD;
I am."&#xD;
"Shall I tell you the future tense of this very indicative&#xD;
mood?" he said touching her cheeks.&#xD;
"If you know it!"&#xD;
"If I know it !-You ~vil1 be (some months later) a&#xD;
Linden flower I - whether wild or tame remains to be&#xD;
Unless Linden flowers can be sometimes found a good&#xD;
deal 'deeper-coloured than pinks, there was at least very&#xD;
little present resemblance. The only notice Faith took of&#xD;
this prophecy was an involuntary one. The door softly&#xD;
opened at this point, and Mrs. Derrick came in to an-&#xD;

ounce tea. She stood still a moment surveying them&#xD;
both.&#xD;
"How do you think she looks, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
His eyes went back to Faith, giving a quick reply which&#xD;
he did not mean they should. ." She looks like a dear child&#xD;
-as she is, Mrs. Derrick. I cannot say much more for&#xD;
her. But I shall take her down to tea."&#xD;
Mrs. Derrh~k went joyfully off for shawls and wrappers.&#xD;
iMir. Linden was silent; his eyes had not stirred. But he&#xD;
amused himself with taking some of the violets from the&#xD;
table near by and fastening them in her belt and hair* the&#xD;
very touch of his fingers telling some things he did not&#xD;
speak.&#xD;
"Sunbeam, do you feel as if you could bear transport.&#xD;
tion ?"&#xD;
"Not as a sunbeam. I could walk do ~yn, I think," said&#xD;
Faith. Mr. Linden remarked that the trhth of that pro-&#xD;
position would never be known; and then she was muffled&#xD;
in a large soft shawl, and carried down stairs and laid on&#xD;
the sofa in the sitting-room. The windows were open for&#xD;
the May wind, but there was a dainty little fire still-every-&#xD;
thing looked strangely familiar; even Mi'. Linden; though&#xD;
his face wore not just its most wanted expression. He&#xD;
had laid her down among the cushions and loosened her&#xD;
wrapping shawl, and paid a little attention to the fire; and&#xD;
now stood in Dr. Harrison's favourite place, looking at&#xD;
her,-perhaps trying to see whether she looked more like&#xD;
herself down ~tairs than she had done above. He could not&#xD;
find that she did. Faith felt as if a great cloud haa rolled&#xD;
over and rolled off from her; yet in her very happiness she&#xD;
had a great desire to cry; her weakness of body helped&#xD;
that. Her head lay still upon the cushions with fingers&#xD;
pressed upon her brow. She hardly dared look at Mr.&#xD;
Linden; her eye wandered over less dangerous things;&#xD;
yet it saw him not the less. How sweetly the wind blew.&#xD;
Mr. Linden went off to the window and picked three or&#xD;
four of the May roses that grew there, ~and then coming to&#xD;
sit down by Faith's sofa softly pushed one of the buds in&#xD;
between her fingers, and made the rest into a breast knot&#xD;
which he laid on the white folds of her dress. He put&#xD;
other roses in her cheeks then, but it was all done with a&#xD;

&#xD;
281&#xD;
&#xD;
curiofl5 quietness that covered less quiet things. Faith&#xD;
took the flowers and played with them, venturing scarce a&#xD;
look of answer. With the wasted cheek, the delicate flush&#xD;
on it, and all the stirred 'fountain of feeling which she was&#xD;
not so able as usual to control, Faith was very lovely; to&#xD;
~liI~h effect the roses and violets scattered over her lent a&#xD;
help of their own. Mr. Linden looked at her,-giving now&#xD;
and then a little arranging touch to flowers or hair-with&#xD;
an unbending face, which ended at last in a very full&#xD;
bright smile ;~ though just why it ~rouged her cheeks so&#xD;
instantly Faith did not feel quite sure. She felt the&#xD;
rouge.&#xD;
"I am glad you feel like yourself again," she remarked.&#xD;
"how do you know that I do ?"&#xD;
"ii think you look so."&#xD;
"Qnite a mistake. I am only bewitched. That is some-&#xD;
what lik~i~I yself, I must own."&#xD;
Faith's face made a remonstrance, not at all calculated to&#xD;
be successful.&#xD;
"Please don't bewitch me then !" said Mr. Linden an-&#xD;
swering the look. "You know I cannot help it-and on&#xD;
the whole you don't wish I could. What do you think of&#xD;
her now, Mrs. Derrick ?" he added, getting up to roll the&#xD;
tea-table close to the sofa. The folding of Mrs. Derrick's&#xD;
hands was significant.&#xD;
"Yes, but you must not look at her so," said Mr. Linden&#xD;
demurely arranging the table and sofa angles in harmonious&#xD;
relation. "You should look with cool unconcern~as I&#xD;
do."&#xD;
"You!" said Mrs. Derrick. "Well I should like to see&#xD;
that for once."&#xD;
Faith laughed again, and was ready for her supper after&#xD;
a new fashion from what she had known for many a day&#xD;
past. There is no doubt but ~ and broiled pigeon&#xD;
were good that night!&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
W HAT a twitter of birds was in Faith's ears as she&#xD;
awoke next morning! Perhaps they were not really&#xD;
more noisy than usual, but she seemed to hear them more;&#xD;
and then it was a soft balmy morning, with a joyous spring&#xD;
sunshine and a dancing spring air, which gave full effect to&#xD;
all the~bird voices. Faith listened to the chorus, the choir,&#xD;
the concert, the solos, with a charmed ear. The minute'~&#xD;
hush; the low twitter-answered softly from bush and tree;&#xD;
the soft chiming in of other notes; the swelling, quicken.&#xD;
lug, increasing song---till every sparrow and killdeer in all&#xD;
Pattaquasset drew his bow and clattered his castanets with&#xD;
the speed and the eagerness of twenty fiddlers. Only&#xD;
in this orchestra the heads turned gracefully on swelling&#xD;
throats, an~ for the angular play of elbows there was the&#xD;
lifting flutter of joyous wings; and the audience of opening&#xD;
leaves 'clapped their little hands' for an encore.&#xD;
Such were the sounds that came to Faith from without;&#xD;
-within her room, Mrs. Derrick moved silently about,&#xD;
lighting the fire, arranging the window curtains, the table&#xD;
and couch, laying out Faith's dressing gown to air) but not&#xD;
saying a word to her yet, lest she might be asleep. Faith&#xD;
could see the relief and gladness in every step her mother&#xD;
took-and well knew why, On the white spread before her&#xD;
lay a glowing little bunch of spring flowers, the last night's&#xD;
dew yet hiding in the depths of the violets, and sprinkling&#xD;
the leaves of the May roses, and making the windflowers&#xD;
look at her with wet eyes. Faith grasped these and held&#xD;
a considerably long conversation with them; then found it&#xD;
in her heart to speak otherwise.&#xD;
"Mother," said she, with a little smile upon the contented&#xD;
languor of convalescence,..-~."you feel better !"&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick came quick to her side, and kissed her and&#xD;
stroked her face. "Pretty child," she said, "so do you."&#xD;
Which fact Faith~ confirmed by setting about the busi~'&#xD;
(282)&#xD;
&#xD;
~O5S of dressing with more energy and good will than' she&#xD;
had for many a day brought to it. The pale cheeks were&#xD;
not quite so pale this morning. The white dress was tied&#xD;
roan4 the waist with that blue ribband of long ago-never&#xD;
yet spoiled with wearing; and in it the roses and violets&#xD;
made a spot of warmer colour.~ When at last she was&#xD;
ready, and had stepped out into the hail, Mr. Linden met&#xD;
her there as he had done the night after the fire ; and as&#xD;
then, stayed her for a minute and scanned her face: with a&#xD;
different look from then, with a different sort of gravity,&#xD;
which gladness did not quite cover up. He asked no&#xD;
questions but with his eyes, and did not say much but&#xD;
with his lips; then carried her down to the breakfast-room.&#xD;
"Mignonette," he said, "what time to-day will it iAease&#xD;
you to take a drive ?"&#xD;
The pleasure of the idea brought the colour to Faith's&#xD;
cheeks. "I suppose I had better ask Dr. Harrison first&#xD;
whether I may go," she said gravely.&#xD;
"Not at all. He has nothing whatever to say about it."&#xD;
"Then as soon as he is gone, I am ready."&#xD;
"We will not wait for him;" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"flut Endy, later will do just as well, won't it ?"&#xD;
"No, love-not half so well."&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"Principally, because I want you to be out when Dr.&#xD;
Harrison comes." And quitting that subject, Mr. Linden&#xD;
wheeled her round to the nearer consideration of biscuits&#xD;
and coffee; leaving Dr. Harrison, for the time, quite out&#xD;
of sight. Out of his own sight, that is; for Faith plainly&#xD;
did not forget him. She was a delicious thing to take care&#xD;
of this morning; in that delicacy of bodily condition to&#xD;
which the strong love to minister, and a tenderness of spirit&#xD;
which grew out of other things and which to-day she had&#xD;
no force to hide. And there was an apprehension which&#xD;
Mr. Linden could see behind her eyes every time they came&#xD;
to his face. Faith was gathering her powers for a struggle.&#xD;
Yet she had no mind to begin it, and waited after breakfast&#xD;
till Mr. Linden should bring up the subject again. He'&#xD;
seemed in no haste to bring it up. For some reason or&#xD;
other, he was in a mood that could not do enough for her.&#xD;
It was a mood Faith must try.&#xD;

&#xD;
As the morning had worn on a~d she saw some pre1i~j.&#xD;
nary movement on Mr. Linden's part, which looked like&#xD;
action, she put her hand in his and lifted her eyes to his&#xD;
face, with a gentle plea in them, speaking in musical soft.&#xD;
ness. "Endy, will you let me wait till Dr. Harrison has&#xD;
made his visit ?" The little hand was clasped and held fast,&#xD;
"He would not wish to see you with me, Mignonette~.&#xD;
and I certainly will not let him see you without."&#xD;
"0 why, Endy?"&#xD;
" Because-Mignonette I cannot tell you. Don't ask me,"&#xD;
Faith flushed and looked troubled but somewhat timid&#xD;
too, and asked no more. She puzzled over the subject.&#xD;
"Then, Endy, suppose we don't go out to drive today ?"&#xD;
"Suppose we do. What are you roughing your cheeks&#xD;
for ?" he added smiling. "Faith, I know I have no legal&#xD;
right to control your actions-.-and yet in this case you must&#xD;
let me say for you what I should for my sister or my wife."&#xD;
How Faith wished to know why. The rouge grew&#xD;
bright; but forbidden to ask, she dared not ask. "Would&#xD;
you care if we did not go out to-day ?" she said with some&#xD;
timid hesitation.&#xD;
"Very much."&#xD;
She was silenced. That Mr. Linden had some strong&#xD;
reason it was plain; not the less the thought of Dr. Har-&#xD;
rison grieved her. But she said nothing. Nor did he,&#xD;
upon that subject,-threw it to the winds apparently. The&#xD;
first move was to take her up stairs again and bestow her&#xD;
daintily among cushions, then to sit by her and spice her&#xD;
cup of chicken broth with pepper and talk, till both it and&#xD;
'~I~5 Faith were warm, and Mrs. Derrick in a state of delight.&#xD;
The good, sweet effect of which mode of treatment, was&#xD;
shewn in the way 'the fringed curtains' of Faith's eyes were&#xD;
by and by dropped by sleep herself. When she awoke&#xD;
Mr. Linden was gone; and Mrs. Derrick sat there keeping&#xD;
watch.&#xD;
"Has the doctor been here, mother ?"&#xD;
"Why child," said her mother, "he's slipped off Stranger,&#xD;
in some of his capers, and hurt his ancle,.-so Reuben says~&#xD;
he won't come till to-morrow. Shall I tell Mr. Linden he&#xD;
may come up ?"&#xD;
f'Yes." Faith felt it a relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Linden came to tell her the carriage was ready.&#xD;
it seemed to Faith as if Jerry knew his old driver, with&#xD;
such good will did he set forth, with such little snorts of&#xD;
high spirit and tossing of head a.nd mane. Down the old&#xD;
farm road? among fields of fresh grain and fresh pioughmg,&#xD;
where blue birds sat on the fences7 and jocund dandelions&#xD;
sunned themselves by the wayside. The breeze came fresh&#xD;
into Faith's face, tossing back her hair; and presently with&#xD;
the scent of buds and flowers and ploughed land came a&#xD;
mingling of the sea breeze, for Mr. Linden was driving&#xD;
that way. He was right to make her come !-Faith felt it&#xD;
in her heart, and so did he. There had been few words&#xD;
spoken hitherto, but now he turned to her with a smile of&#xD;
great satisfaction, saying,&#xD;
"Mignonette, this breeze is telling upon your cheeks."&#xD;
"It is going all through me I" said Faith, drawing an&#xD;
eager breath of appreciation. Mr. Linden gave her shawls&#xD;
and cushions some arranging touches, and to her a glad&#xD;
word or two of answer, then drove on down to the shore.&#xD;
Not at their usual bathing and picnic place, but at the fur-&#xD;
ther out Barley Point; where the breeze came in its full&#xD;
freshness and the waves rolled in white-crested. There he&#xD;
made Jerry stand still for ~ while, and made Faith lean&#xD;
upon him and so rest.&#xD;
They were somewhat elevated above the sea, where the&#xD;
barren face of the land broke down suddenly some twenty&#xD;
feet. With what a sweet dash the waves broke upon the&#xD;
beach, chasing up the wet sand and laying down a little&#xD;
freight of seaweed here and there: how the water sparkled&#xD;
and glittered, and was blue and white and green and neu-&#xD;
tral tint,.-.how the gulls soared and stooped and flapped&#xD;
their wings "jn the gay breeze, before which the white-&#xD;
winged vessels flew on a more steady course. Jerry pawed&#xD;
the turf and shook his head in approbation, and Faith's&#xD;
head lay very still. Perhaps Mr. Linden thought she had&#xD;
done talking enough that day, for he was rather silent;&#xD;
only watching her lest she should be tired, or have too&#xD;
much of the air. What he watched her for all the rest Qf&#xD;
the time, was best known to himself. Her brow had its&#xD;
old quiet again now, though her face was grave beyond its&#xD;
old wont; and the eyes, as he could see them, were softly&#xD;

&#xD;
grave and softly glad together, intently going from the&#xD;
white-tipped water to the white-winged gulls and the&#xD;
clouds grey and white that sailed above them. Suddenly,&#xD;
after a long roaming over the fresh life that was abroad&#xD;
there, the eyes were lifted to jiis face.&#xD;
Endecott-if 11 don't say anything, it is because II cafl'~&#xD;
say anything good enough I"&#xD;
"Faith," he said with that same glad look at her, "your&#xD;
face says that you are getting better every minute. Not&#xD;
tired yet ?"&#xD;
"I feel as if I was in a grand dream."&#xD;
"Do you ?" said Mr. Linden,.-.-." I am glad I do not.&#xD;
It brings me out of a. dream to see you begin to look&#xD;
like yourself. I have not felt so real before since [came&#xD;
home."&#xD;
"You are real enough," said Faith; "and so is every-&#xD;
thing else. Jt is only my feeling that is dreamy. And&#xD;
this air will wake me up, if I stay here a little while&#xD;
longer. How good it is !"&#xD;
"Do you see that dark rock out in th9 midst of the&#xD;
waves? and how the waves half cover and then leave it&#xD;
bare ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"I was thinking of what Rutherford says of the chang-&#xD;
ing, swaying, unsteady tide of life-joys and sorrows&#xD;
'Our rock doth not ebb and flow, but our sea'."&#xD;
Faith thought her own life had not been much' like that&#xD;
changing tide; then remembered his had, in nearer measure.&#xD;
The next question was not far off; she put it, looking up&#xD;
anxiously and regretfully. "Endecott, what are you work- 1'&#xD;
ing so hard for ?"&#xD;
A very gay change of face answered her.&#xD;
"So hard as what?"&#xD;
"As you do."&#xD;
"What makes - you think I am working 'so hard,' little&#xD;
Mignonette ?-~have I given you that impression? I did&#xD;
not mean it. Do I look overworked ?"&#xD;
"No-)' said Faith-.-."I think not,-..-...but that is not the&#xD;
thing. Why do you, Endecott ?"&#xD;
It was a very gently put question, but put with eyes and&#xD;
lips as well as the sweet voice, dainty in its half timidity&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
mixed with the sweetness. Mr. Linden looked down at&#xD;
her till the question was finished, but then he looked off at&#xD;
the dancing water; the smile which had been dawning&#xD;
upon his lips breaking out into very full sunshine. It was&#xD;
a strange smile-very enjoying and yet a little mosred.&#xD;
"Mignonette," he said looking down at her again, "do&#xD;
you know what a dear little child you are ?"&#xD;
Her eyes wavered, then faced him again with ~ sort of&#xD;
smiling gravity, as not relinquishing their answer.&#xD;
"You will be dreadfully shocked if I tell you."&#xD;
"Shall I ?"-she said, not believing him.&#xD;
"Yes. But what do you suppose I am doing ?-what&#xD;
has put all this into your head ?"&#xD;
"I heard it," said Faith.&#xD;
"From whom?"&#xD;
"I don't know. But somebody that wondered what you&#xD;
were doing it for."&#xD;
"Most enigmatical information! What 'it' did some-&#xD;
body say I was doing?"&#xD;
"Working hard-giving lessons," said Faith dropping&#xD;
her voice.&#xD;
"Well-what else was I doing when I was here? That&#xD;
should not shock you, dear child."&#xD;
"You were not doing anything else when you were here.&#xD;
-that is the very thing, Endecott."&#xD;
"Mignonette--i have done nothing to hurt njiyselt as&#xD;
you may see. I am very strong to work."&#xD;
She gave a little grave glance at him, grave with a back-&#xD;
ground of regretfulness, and placed herself back in her for-&#xD;
mer position; pushing her questions no further. But Mr.&#xD;
Linden did not look grave.&#xD;
"I am quite willing 'to tell you all about my work," he&#xD;
said,-"that I did not long ago was for two or three rea-&#xD;
sons which you will understand. I told you once, dear&#xD;
Faith~-....upon a night which I shall never forget-that I&#xD;
had means enough to carry me through my studies; but&#xD;
two things made me take measures to earn a good deal&#xD;
more. One was, that I would always rather work than not&#xD;
to have what I want to spend in various good and' pleasant&#xD;
ways."&#xD;

"Yes- ?" she said a little eagerly, lie looked at hei'&#xD;
with that same smile coming over his face.&#xD;
"It will shock you," he said,-" however.-.The other&#xD;
reason was this. Wea~reed how I should choose etw~&#xD;

Yes, plainly enough; as he could tell by the bright flush&#xD;
which mounted up to her forehead and made her a Rho.&#xD;
dora again. And d6ubtless Faith would have said several&#xD;
things, only-she could not! and so sat like the stillest of&#xD;
scared mice; with no more words at command. Mr. Linden&#xD;
laughed-telling her he thought there was no hope of&#xD;
benefitting her checks any further that day, and that to&#xD;
judge by her eyelids sleep would be the next thing; arid&#xD;
so turned the little carriage round and Jerry's head towards&#xD;
home.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
P INNER was ready when they reached home, so that&#xD;
Faith was taken at once to the table; and when din-&#xD;
ner was over, up stairs to go to sleep. And sleep held her&#xD;
well nigh all the afternoon. The sunbeams were long, the&#xD;
light of day was growing gentle, when Faith at last awoke&#xD;
and arose, with a tinge in her cheeks anl a face getting to&#xD;
be itself again. She put her hair and her dress in fresh&#xD;
order, and went softly about doing the same office for&#xD;
several things in the room; thinking all the while what&#xD;
Mr. Linden had been working for, and how shut her moqth&#xD;
was from saying anything about it.&#xD;
"Where is MrE Linden, ~mother ?"&#xD;
"Down stairs."&#xD;
"I am going down too. I am quite well enough without&#xD;
being carried. Come, mother."&#xD;
"He won't like it, child~.~~you'd better let me call him."&#xD;
"No indeed," said Fa~th. "I'll just take your arm,&#xD;
mother. It will do me good."&#xD;
So softly and with a little wilful pleasure on Faith's part,&#xD;
the stairs were descended; and not content with that, Faith&#xD;
went into the tea-room and began as of old to give a~ deli-&#xD;
cate hand to the tea-table arrangements. Then when all&#xD;
was done, slo~vly made her entrance into ~he other room.&#xD;
But there, to Faith's dismay, were two gentlemen instead of&#xD;
one, standing in the middle of the floor in earnest conver-&#xD;
sation. Both turned the minute she opened the door, and&#xD;
Squire Stoutenburgh came towards her, exclaiming, "Why&#xD;
Miss Faith !-.--nobody gave me any hope of seeing you.&#xD;
My dear, are you as well as you look ?"&#xD;
Faith's instant extreme desire was to quit the field she&#xD;
had so rashly ventured upon. iler answer to Mr. Stout-&#xD;
enburgh, if made, was too unintelligible to be understood&#xD;
or remembered* and meanwhile she was as~ the Squire had&#xD;
hinted, looking very well~ and~ a picture of dainty confu-&#xD;
sion. It might not help the confusion, though it did put&#xD;

"No, she is not as well as she looks, Mr. Stoutenburgh,&#xD;
and therefore you must not keep her standing."&#xD;
"I won't keep her-nor you neither-long," said&#xD;
Squire. "Miss Faith, I hope you'll keep h~m-standing&#xD;

going to stay, sure enough ?"&#xD;
"Till I must go." Faith heard the smile with which it&#xD;
was spoken.&#xD;

enburgh, with a sort of earnest heartiness which became&#xD;
him very well. "My dear, I'm as glad as if you were my&#xD;
own daughter-.--and you'll let me say that,, because your&#xD;
father and I were such friends." With which original and&#xD;
sincere expression of feeling the Squire went off.&#xD;
"YQu naughty child," Mr. Linden said, coming back to&#xD;
Faith's chair, "who gave you leave to come down stairs?&#xD;
I shouldn't be at all surprised if you had been after&#xD;
cream."&#xD;
"No I haven't Endy,"-said Faith lifting up her face&#xD;
which was in a sort of overwhelmed state.&#xD;
"What is the matter ?" he said smiling.&#xD;
"Don't mind me," said Faith passing her hands over her ~&#xD;
face. I am half ashamed of myself-I shall be better in a ~;&#xD;
day or two."&#xD;
"How do ~ou feel, after your ride and your sleep ?"&#xD;
"0 well !-nicely,"-she said in happy accents.&#xD;
"What made you try to walk down stairs ?"&#xD;
"I thought I could do it."&#xD;
"And knew I would not let you. Will you be in a talk.&#xD;
ing mood after tea ?"&#xD;
"I am now. I have been wanting to talk to you, Ende.&#xD;
cott, ever since you got home."&#xD;
"What about ?"&#xD;
"About these weeks."&#xD;
The summons to tea came then, however; but when tea&#xD;
was disposed of, and Faith had come back to her sofa in&#xD;
the sitting-room, Mr. Linden took his place at her side.&#xD;
"Now I am ready for 'these weeks'," he said.&#xD;
Faith was less ready than he, though she had wished for&#xD;
&#xD;
the talk. Her face darkened to something of the weary&#xD;
look with which he had found her.&#xD;
"iEndecOtt, I have wanted to see you dreadfully!" He&#xD;
looked pained-not merely, she knew, because of that: but&#xD;
the thought had no further expression.&#xD;
"What has been the matter, my dear child ?"&#xD;
Faith's hand and head went down on his shoulder, as on&#xD;
a rest they had long coveted. "I am afraid you will be&#xD;
ashamed of me, Endecott, -but I will tell you. You&#xD;
know since II have been sick I have seen a great deal of&#xD;
Pr. Harrison-every day, and twice a day. I couldn't&#xD;
help it."&#xD;
"And Endy,-he used to talk to me."-&#xD;
"Yes,"-.-the word was .short and grave.&#xD;
"'I don't know why he did it; and I did not like it, and&#xD;
I could not help it. He would tallC to me about J3ible&#xD;
things."&#xD;
"Well ?-He used to do that long ago."&#xD;
"And long ago ~QU told me not to let him talk to me of&#xD;
his doubts and false opinions. Endecott, I didn't forget&#xD;
that-I remembered it all the while,-and yet he did talk&#xD;
to me of those things, and I could not tell how to hinder&#xD;
it. And then, Endecott.-the things were in my head-&#xD;
and I could not get them out !"..-The manner of Faith's&#xD;
slow words told of a great deal of heart-work.&#xD;
Mr. Linden did not start-but Faith felt f~ie thrill which&#xD;
j~ passed over him, even to the fingers that held hers. Clearly&#xD;
this was not what he expected.&#xD;
"Faith,"-he said,-" has he touched your faith ?"&#xD;
Faith's head drew nearer to his, with a manner half&#xD;
caressing, half shrinking, but the answer was a low, "No-&#xD;
never. "&#xD;
"Child 1" he said with a sort of deep terror in his voice,&#xD;
.-" I think I could not have borne that. I woJd rather&#xD;
he had won away your heart from me 1"&#xD;
Faith did not move, and seemed to herself scarce to&#xD;
breathe, such a spasm of various feelings was upon her&#xD;
heart. "It did not, Endy,"-she whispered.&#xD;
He stooped to kiss her, as if that was the only answer&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
he could give just then; merely saying, "Tell me all&#xD;
about it."&#xD;
"I don't know how he did it "-Faith went on hesi.&#xD;
tatingly, as if the words were not easy to her ;-.u' and&#xD;
always before I knew it was~ coming, it was said,-...some.&#xD;
thing that troubled me; almost every time he came. ~&#xD;
don't know whether it troubled him too, or whether~But&#xD;
no matter what it was said for! lie would tell me of soi~&#xD;
question that had occurred to him, or some difficulty that&#xD;
he could not understand; or else it was a contrary fact that&#xD;
somebody else had stated, or a cunning explanation that&#xD;
somebody had found out, or a discovery that was against&#xD;
the truth, or some train of consequences and inferences&#xD;
that would undermine it. And these things were always&#xD;
so curiously put, that though I knew they were false, Endy&#xD;
never doubted that-I knew they were not the truth;&#xD;
.-.yet I could not shew him that they were not; and that&#xD;
hurt me. It pained me by day and by night ;-~but that&#xD;
was not all." Faith hesitated. "These things never did&#xD;
touch my faith, Endecott~but it seems to me now as if&#xD;
they had shut it up in a fortress and besieged it. I hadn't&#xD;
a bit of comfort of it except by snatches~only I knew it&#xD;
was therefore ever so lono', When I tried to read the&#xD;
Bible, often I could think of nothing but these thoughts&#xD;
would push themselves in between.......like a swarm of gnats&#xD;
humming in my ears ;-and often I had no good of prayer,"&#xD;
.-.--she added in a yet lower voice.&#xD;
"Have you now ?" Mr. Linden said. "Has that passed&#xD;
away ?"&#xD;
She hesitated again, perhaps struggling with some emo-&#xD;
tion which she would not let get the better of her. I~Ier&#xD;
words were quiet. '"It is passing. Earth and sky are all&#xD;
cleared since you came-~...as I knew they would be."&#xD;
Mr. Linden was silent and. motionless,..looking down at&#xD;
her, curbing as he best might the grief and indignation&#xD;
which w1ere by turns as much as he could manage. lie did&#xD;
not spej~k for some time.&#xD;
"I t~nk, Endy,"' said Faith, "I shouldn't have felt so if&#xD;
I had been well and strong. I am almost sure it was&#xD;
partly that. I wasn't strong in mind or body~and how I&#xD;
wanted you !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"And where was my place in the world if not here ~&#xD;
"I didn't want you till you came," she said in a very&#xD;
sweet low tone.&#xD;
"Ah, child! you do not know what you are talking of,-.&#xD;
nor what a snare was spread for you."&#xD;
"Do you think that, Eudy ?" she said in a scared way.&#xD;
"W'hat else?"&#xD;
"But he always seemed-I always hoped, he was really&#xD;
interested in those things himself."&#xD;
"No man carries truth in one hand and falsehood in the&#xD;
other;" said Mr. Linden sternly.&#xD;
Faith was sitting upright, looking very thoughtful and&#xD;
very grieved. "But you do not think, Endecott,-you do&#xD;
not thiuk.-there was no truth in it ?"&#xD;
His face caught her grieved look,-lie answered slowly,&#xD;
"Child, you must leave all that. I only know that he tried&#xD;
to get rid, of every barrier in his way."&#xD;
"And how in this, Endecott ?.-What ?"&#xD;
"He doubtless thought your belief stood between him&#xD;
and your favour."&#xD;
"And that if he could change that !"-Faith'~ head&#xD;
sank with a low word of pain. Mr. Linden was silent. She&#xD;
looked up again, with a face of yearning sorrow which it&#xD;
was a pity perhaps Pr. Harrison could not see. "And&#xD;
now," she said, "we never can do anything more for him I"&#xD;
But Mr. Linden was not ready for the wish,-the stern-&#xD;
ness of his face did not relax this time even under the&#xD;
power of hers. Until as he looked, with the sight of all&#xD;
her loveliness and the thought of all the wrong done her,&#xD;
came the keen realization of why it had been done p-then&#xD;
his look changed and saddened.&#xD;
"Endecott," she said after a while, humbly, "do you&#xD;
think anSr one who loves Christ could be brought to disbe-&#xD;
lieve him ?"&#xD;
"No-not really and permanently. The promise ~ays,&#xD;
'Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore ~ill I&#xD;
deliver him'."&#xD;
"Then what did you fear so much for me, Endy ?"&#xD;
She had cause for the question; he had spoken and looked&#xD;
and listened with that intentness of sense which shews some&#xD;
25*&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
hidden anxiety,-..-.measuring jealously every look and word&#xD;
of hers by some old well-remembered standard.&#xD;
"You remember, dear Faith," he said, "that when tIle&#xD;
thieves set upon one of the pilgrims, though he made out&#xD;
to keep his jewels yet they todk from him all his spending&#xD;
money; and in the want of that he went to the end of h~&#xD;
life."&#xD;
But the smile that answered him was an answering&#xD;
smile. Though there was sorrow in it, and humbleness, and&#xD;
even fear, its fullest burdens were the free guaranty that she&#xD;
was not hurt, and an untold wealth of affection, that almost&#xD;
breathed out of the moving and parted lips. "Endy,.~It&#xD;
was only a cloud-.--I knew at the time it would scatter&#xD;
away just as soon as you came.' I' knew it was a cloud, but&#xD;
I wasn't well."&#xD;
Mr. Linden lifted her face, gazing at it intently. "My&#xD;
little Mignonette," he said, "are you sure that you 'hold&#xD;
fast the beginning of your confidence'? Are you sure he&#xD;
has not dimmed the light that used to shine so bright in&#xD;
your heart ?.-that he has not made heaven seem less real,&#xD;
nor the promises of less effect? Are you sure, Faith ?-Jf&#xD;
he has, find it out now I"&#xD;
She had never seen him look so-never heard him speak&#xD;
with such~ earnestness. The words seemed to come from&#xD;
the very Thpths of his heart; freighted not only with their&#xD;
own moment, but with the pain which the raising such&#xD;
questions had stirred in him. Faith knew little of even the&#xD;
pictures of angels-if she had she might have thought of&#xD;
one then. Her child nature would have thrown itself into&#xD;
his arms to give the answer; as it was, the woman drew a&#xD;
little back and spoke with veiled eyes.&#xD;
"If he has, I don't know it, Endecott. It was a cloud&#xD;
that hindered all enjoyment from me,-I knew at the time&#xD;
it was no more. lit is gone, or almost. It was wrong to&#xD;
be on me at all-but I was weak and not well." Her&#xD;
spee~i was very humble, and the innocent trembling of the&#xD;
lips was as on.p might answer an angel.&#xD;
His eyes changed as she spoke, watching her still7 but less&#xD;
clearly; and bringing her where she had not dared to place&#xD;
herself, Mr. Linden kissed her again and again - as one&#xD;
rejoices over what has been lost or in deadly peril. Not&#xD;
&#xD;
many words - and those low and half uttered, of deep&#xD;
~li~nk5giVil~g, of untold tenderness. But Faith hid her&#xD;
face in her hands, and though she did not shed any tears,&#xD;
shook and trembled.&#xD;
"This will not do, for you nor for me," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
4~IV1ignOnettehave my words grieved you? they need&#xD;
not-.--there was not a breath in them harsher than a summer&#xD;
* "I didn't think it, Endy."&#xD;
"What are you thinking of, my child 7"&#xD;
"Nothing-Never mind me,-" she said deprecatingly.&#xD;
"Tell me, Faith," he repeated.&#xD;
But she did not. The quivering emotionipassed away or&#xD;
'was overcome; and then her answer was. a~very grave and~&#xD;
sweet look and smile; still such a one as might without any&#xD;
force have been given to an angel. ~&#xD;
"Faith, what will make you speak ?-this ?-..-. Tell me&#xD;
wba~ you were trembling about-I shall begin to think you&#xD;
have grown afraid of me."&#xD;
"I don't think I have,-" she said very quietly.&#xD;
"You are a sort of willowbrauch,-SO very pliant that&#xD;
you glide out of reach on the very breath that comes after&#xD;
you. Now I think the very profound confidence I reposed in&#xD;
you this morning, deserves some return. I'm afraid I can-&#xD;
not ask for it with such persuasive eyes.~~&#xD;
"It's no confidence-" said Faith. "I didn't know I&#xD;
had been in such danger; and"-she spoke with some diffi-&#xD;
culty-" I didn't know what it would be to offend you."&#xD;
"Did you think you could ?"&#xD;
"If I did wrong--- ?"&#xD;
"Faith," he said, "do you know what I should expect&#xD;
'if I did wrong', as yo'u say ?-that you would break your&#xD;
heart, perhaps, but never that you* would be offended. I&#xD;
should 'expect to find you more than ever my sweet minis-'&#xD;
tering spirit."&#xD;
A look of intense grave earnestness followed and echoed&#xD;
his thought with one or txvo of her4 own; then her gravity&#xD;
broke in a radiant little smile. "I aTh not exactly like you,&#xD;
Endecott," she said.&#xD;
"What is the precise bearing of that remark ?"&#xD;
"You might be offended - where I should have no&#xD;

right,-" she said with slow utterance and consideration of&#xD;
her words.&#xD;
"But why.-.-little Arabic poem ?~"&#xD;
The colour started into Faith's cheeks, but she answered&#xD;
"You are better than J,~-~.-and besides,.-you know, Endy!&#xD;
~-it would be right for you to do what it wouldn't he r1gl~t&#xD;
for me to do." Her colour deepened to brightness and her&#xD;
eyes were very cast down. Mr. Linden looked at her...&#xD;
smiling a grave sweet smile.&#xD;
"Faith," he said, "I have heard-or imagined~that a&#xD;
man might have an angel for his wife, but I never heard&#xD;
yet of a woman who had an angel for her husband-....did&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
Faith endeavored to shield her eyes and cheek with a&#xD;
very insufficient hand. "You put me in the witness-box,.~.&#xD;
what can I do ?" she said.&#xD;
"You can do one thing as well as anybody I ever saw"&#xD;
Mr. Linden said, taking her hand down. "Faith, where&#xD;
did you get such pink cheeks ?"&#xD;
"What is an Arabic poem ?" said Faith gravely.&#xD;
"A pretty thing that requires translating. Faith, I have&#xD;
a great desire to take you all about Pattaquasset and tell&#xD;
everybody what you are to be."&#xD;
"Endecott !".-said Faith with a startled glance.&#xD;
"What ?" he answered laughing.&#xD;
"Why do you say so ?"&#xD;
"Just imagine the delight of all Quapaw, and the full&#xD;
satisfaction of the Roscoms. Shouldn't you like to see it ?"&#xD;
Faith looked at him in a sort of frightened mood of&#xD;
mind, discerning some earnest in the play. Mr. Linden's&#xD;
face did not reassure her, though he carried the play at that&#xD;
time no further.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
JF the fears of the night before had not quite been slept&#xD;
off, if the alarming ideas had not all been left in dream-&#xD;
land, still it was hard for anything but peace and pleasure&#xD;
to shew its head that morning: in at Faith's window came&#xD;
the sunbeams, the tiny panes of glass showed each a patch&#xD;
of the bluest sky, and through some unseen open sash the&#xD;
morning air swept in full sweetness. When Faith opened&#xD;
her own window, the twitter and song of all manner of&#xD;
birds was something to hear, and their quick motions were&#xD;
something to see. From the sweetbriar on the house to the&#xD;
trees in the orchaid,-from the mud nest under the eaves&#xD;
to the hole in the barn wall,.-.-what darting and skimming&#xD;
and fluttering! Off in the orchard the apple trees were softly&#xD;
putting on their nonpareil dress of blossoms, feeding the&#xD;
air with nectar till it was half intoxicated; and d~own in the&#xD;
garden a little bevy of bells stood prim and soft and sweet,&#xD;
ringing their noiseless spring chimes under Faith's window.&#xD;
IJnder her window too, that is within close sight of it,&#xD;
stood Reuben Taylor and Mr. Linden. Not watching for&#xD;
her just then as it appeared, but intent upon their own con-&#xD;
cerns. Or rather, Reuben-in his usual da~rk, neat dress&#xD;
and straw hat, with hands neither busy nor at rest, but&#xD;
waiting and ready-was intent upon Mr. Linden-and Mr.&#xD;
Linden upon his work. his hat was off, on the grass&#xD;
beside him, and he himself-half sitting half leaning upon&#xD;
an old crooked apple tree, had his hands full of cowslips-&#xD;
thouo~h what lie was doing with them Faith could not tell.&#xD;
Only from a fluttering end of blue ribband? that appeared,&#xD;
she could guess their destination. The two friends were&#xD;
talking busily and merrily, with little cowslip interludes,&#xD;
and the yellow blossoms sprinkled the grass all about the&#xD;
tree, some having dropped down, others been tossed off as&#xD;
not worthy a place in the ball. For that was the work in&#xD;
Mr. Linden's hands - something which Faith had never&#xD;
seen.&#xD;

298                SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
It was so very pretty a picture that Faith sat down to&#xD;
look at it, and thoughtless of being found out, looked on i~&#xD;
a dream. Mr. Linden's threats of yesterday did come hack&#xD;
to her shrinkingly, but she thi;ew them off; the time was too&#xD;
happy to hear tbe shadow of anything weightier than apple&#xD;
blossoms. Faith looked out through them admiringly,&#xD;
marvelling anew how Mr. Linden had ever come to like her;&#xD;
and while her soft eyes were studying him, her heart made&#xD;
many a vow before the time. She only felt the birds fly&#xD;
past; her mind was taking strange glimpses into the&#xD;
future.&#xD;
Stepping jauntily out from the house,~Sam Stcntenburgh&#xD;
came next upon the scene, the springtime of his man's&#xD;
attire suiting well enough with his years but not so well&#xD;
- with his surroundings; too desperately smart for the cow-&#xD;
slips, bright and shining as they were there in the sun, too&#xD;
new for the tulips-..-though they had been out of the ground&#xD;
but a few days. For&#xD;
In a little bit of garden ground&#xD;
Where many a lovely plant. was found,&#xD;
Stood a tulip in gay attire!&#xD;
His pantaloons green as ever were seen,&#xD;
His cap was as red as fire.&#xD;
But the tulip was at least used to his cap...-.which wa~&#xD;
more than could be said of Sam and his hat.&#xD;
"Mrs. Derrick told me to come out here and find you,&#xD;
sir," he said. "But what are you doing, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I am making a ball."&#xD;
"iX. ball I"&#xD;
"Yes," said Mr. Linden,-" gratifying one of my youth~&#xD;
ful tastes. Sam, I'll lend you my hat."&#xD;
"Why! what for, sir ?" said Sam, a little confused and&#xD;
a good deal puzzled, while Reuben smiled.&#xD;
"Just to save you from the headache while you stand&#xD;
there in the sun," said Mr. Linden, tying the ends of his&#xD;
ribband together. "It's a man's hat, Sam-you need not&#xD;
be afraid of it. That's a good lesson in whistling !" he&#xD;
said, looking up into the tree over his head, where a robin&#xD;
had just come to exercise his powers. But as Mr. Linden's&#xD;
eyes came hack from the robin they caught sight of Faith&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.            299&#xD;
&#xD;
at her window, and instantly he was on his feet and made&#xD;
her a ~~St graceful and low reverence. Instinctively the&#xD;
two boys turned and followed suit-the one with his straw&#xD;
hat the other with his beaver.&#xD;
Faith's contemplative quiet was broken up, and her~ f~4~&#xD;
grew shy and flushed as she gave her tiny grave signs of&#xD;
recognition; but a soft 'good morning' floated down to&#xD;
them, f0lIowed~~nobody knows why-by a more particular&#xD;
"Good morning, Sam."&#xD;
"Miss Faith !" said Sam affectingly, "are you always&#xD;
going to stay up stairs ?"&#xD;
"No-I am coming down presently. You are early to..&#xD;
day, Sam."&#xD;
"Not earlier than I've been some other days, Miss&#xD;
Faith."&#xD;
Faith nodded at him and left the windQw; threw round&#xD;
her the light shawl which she was expected to wear because&#xD;
she had been sick, rather than because the May air called&#xD;
for it, and prepared to go down. But in the second of&#xD;
time which all this tqok, she heard her' name called from&#xD;
the orchard-not very loud but very distinct.&#xD;
"Faith!"&#xD;
She knew who called, and it was with a little startled&#xD;
thrill that she presented herself at the windoW to answer&#xD;
the summons. Mr. Linden stood close beneath it.&#xD;
"Can you catch this ?" he said, looking up at her with&#xD;
laughing eyes. And the soft cowslip ball came whirling&#xD;
up to bury its golden head in her hands. If Faith saw&#xD;
anything else, it was the very evident astonishment of one&#xD;
of the standers-by. But nevertheless she bravely put her&#xD;
bright blushing face out again.&#xD;
"Thank you, Mr. Linden," she said. "It's too pretty to&#xD;
be thrown more than once."&#xD;
"Are you ready to come yourself?"&#xD;
"Yes, I'm coming."&#xD;
He bowed and turned away, passing on into the house&#xD;
with so quick a step that he was at the head of the stairs&#xD;
as soon as she was.&#xD;
"You are not going to carry me down to-day !"-.-said&#xD;
Faith starting back. "I can walk down as well as you can&#xD;
-or at least I can as well walk down."&#xD;

&#xD;
"There is rio one in the parlour, Mignonette."&#xD;
"Then I'll not go there," said Faith smiling.&#xD;
"I'll take you to the garden, if YOU prefer it. Is ti~&#xD;
supposed fact of your being able to walk down stairs any&#xD;
reason why you should not Iid me good morning ?"&#xD;
There was neither that nor any other existing reason,&#xD;
to judge by the quiet grace with which Faith drew near&#xD;
to give the required good morning, or rather to permit ~&#xD;
Linden to take it; and then placed her hand in his, as will.&#xD;
ing to have so much aid from him as that could give, lie&#xD;
held it fast, and her too, for a minute, while his other hand&#xD;
busied itself with fastening in her belt a dewy, sweet, 5Ofl~j0&#xD;
looking little sprig of May roses.&#xD;
"How do you feel this morning ?" he said when he was&#xD;
gravely considering the effect.&#xD;
"Very much Jike Spring !"-Faith looked so, with her&#xD;
other hand full of primroses.&#xD;
"And otherwise ?"&#xD;
"I don't feel otherwise !" said Faith laughing; the first&#xD;
really free merry look of laughter he had seen on her face&#xD;
since he came home.&#xD;
"You are the sweetest of all spring blossoms," Mr. Liii-&#xD;
den said, carrying her off with perfect disregard of the&#xD;
supposed fact of her being able to walk. At the foot of&#xD;
the stairs, however, she was~permitted to find her feet again.&#xD;
"Where will you go, dear child ?...-the orchard is very wet,&#xD;
but you may venture as far as the door."&#xD;
"No, I have something to do," said Faith.&#xD;
"What have you to do ?"&#xD;
"What I used to take care of-part of it. I'm so glad&#xD;
to do it again."&#xD;
"Not to-day--.-you ought not !-.nor to-morrow. You&#xD;
must come in here and sit quiet till breakfast, and for a few '&#xD;
days more be content to be 'Love in idleness' as welL as&#xD;
Miguonette. Will you promise ?" he said, seating her in&#xD;
the easy-chair, with open window, and breakfast tahle, and ;&#xD;
a gay little fire to make the captivity pleasant.&#xD;
"But I like work, Endy and a little won't hurt me.&#xD;
Those boys want yon.-.-and I'll make the coffee."&#xD;
"Do you know, Mignonette, how pale you would be if I&#xD;
were 'away ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
301&#xD;
&#xD;
She shook her head.&#xD;
"I do," said Mr. Linden,-" and as I am in a mood for&#xD;
~~5es this morning, I want you to let me bring 'those boys'&#xD;
in here~then they can see me and I can see you."&#xD;
The roses cam~ started and brightened, and her eyes&#xD;
looked a soft protest; but it was a minority protest and&#xD;
gave way, and her face after all told him he might do what&#xD;
he liked. He gave her a reassuring smile, and went back&#xD;
to the orchard, presently returning with Reuben and Sam,&#xD;
.-the one wearing a face of unqualified pleasure, the other&#xD;
of almost as unqualified shyness. Sam was not quite sure&#xD;
that his ears had reported correctly, but the doubt and the&#xD;
new idea were enough to discompose him thoroughly. . He&#xD;
listened eagerly to the answers Reuben's words called forth,&#xD;
but seemed afraid to venture many himself. As for Mr.&#xD;
Linden, he was combining another handful of flowers-&#xD;
covering his amusement with very grave composure.&#xD;
It was not bad amusement; for the exquisite simplicity&#xD;
in Faith's manner, with the contrast of the coming and&#xD;
going colour and the shy eyelashes, made a picture that&#xD;
any one claiming interest in it would have been a little&#xD;
proud of. And the roses in her belt and the cowslips in&#xD;
her hand and the delicate lines of her face which health&#xD;
had not yet rounded out again, all joined to make the&#xD;
vision a very fair one. She was most shy of Sam, and did&#xD;
not look at Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"I haven't thanked you for your pigeons, Sam," she said,&#xD;
after a few lively words with Reuben.&#xD;
"No, Miss Faith, please don't 1" was the gallant rejoinder.&#xD;
"Weren't they worth thanks ?" inquired Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"I thought they were, when I was eating them; and&#xD;
mother said they were the best I had. Don'tfyou like to&#xD;
be thanked, Sam ?"&#xD;
"When it's worth while," said Sam. "But you know,&#xD;
ma'am-You know, Mr. Linden, it's thanks enough to do&#xD;
anything for Miss Faith."&#xD;
"I know that very well." Quiet as the words were&#xD;
they brought all Sam's ideas to the ground like his own&#xD;
pigeons.&#xD;
"Where are you now in college, Sam ?" Faith went on&#xD;
perhaps because she felt herself a coward.&#xD;

[I         Sam  made answer, in a more subdued state of mi~&#xD;
than was usual when he announced his Sophomorical clis.&#xD;
tinctions.&#xD;
"What are you going to d~o when you come out ?"&#xD;
"0 I don't know, Miss Faith,.-father says I can do&#xD;
just what I like."&#xD;
"And you don't know what that will be, Sam ?"&#xD;
"No-" said Sam. "I can't even guess."&#xD;
'11        "A man who can do what he likes ought to do a great&#xD;
deal," said Mr. Linden. "Reuben, will you take the upper&#xD;
road home, and give these flowers to Ency Stephens for&#xD;
Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
"0 yes, sir !" Reuben said.&#xD;
"No, Reuben! I didn't seu4 them," said Thiith eagerly.&#xD;
"Tell her," said Mr. Linden smiling, "that they came&#xD;
from Miss Faith's garden, and that I shall bring IMiss&#xD;
Faith herself to see her, just so soon as she can bear such&#xD;
a long drive." The bunch of flowers was laid lightly on&#xD;
her hands for her disposal. "Now I must send you two&#xD;
collegians-present and future-away, for you have had&#xD;
your breakfast and we have not had ours."&#xD;
At i~hich remark Sam took Faith's hand with a bow of&#xD;
great perplexity and reverence, and Reuben drew near and&#xD;
waited for the flowers.&#xD;
"Give them to her from Mr. Linden," said Faith, rosy&#xD;
red, as she put them in his keeping ;.-" she will like that&#xD;
best, Reuben."&#xD;
Reuben thought he knew how to combine the two mes-&#xD;
sages, and the boys went off just as the coffee-pot came in.&#xD;
"Faith," said Mr. Linden coming back to sit down by her,&#xD;
"here is a rosebud so much like, you that I think I ought&#xD;
to wear it. What do you consider the most appropriate&#xD;
way?''&#xD;
"How do gentlemen wear flowers ?-You'll have to stick&#xD;
it in a buttonhole," said Faith half grave and half laugh~&#xD;
ing,-" if it must be worn."&#xD;
"But that is to treat it as a common flower !"&#xD;
"You'll have to treat it so," said Faith glancing from&#xD;
the rosebud to him.&#xD;
"Look at it," said Mr. Linden,-."do you see how very&#xD;
lovely it is ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
She did look at it, more closely, and then at him with an&#xD;
appeal of grave remonstrance, deep though unspoken. But&#xD;
ft was met defiantly.&#xD;
"If I am to wear this, Mignonette, you must put it in&#xD;
place."&#xD;
Faith was a little shy of even doing so much, and be~&#xD;
sides was aware that her mother as well as the coffee-pot&#xD;
had come upon the scene. However she took the flower&#xD;
and succeeded in attaching it securely where she thought it&#xD;
ought to go, on the breast of Mr. Linden's waistcoat; by&#xD;
which time the resemblance between the two rosebuds was&#xD;
perfect, and striking; and Faith drew back to her break.&#xD;
fast, glad to have everybody's attention diverted to coffee,&#xD;
which she declared was good with cowslips. It may be said&#xD;
that the diversion was not immediate; for though her chair&#xD;
was at once wheeled round to the table, yet Faith had to&#xD;
take her thanks then and there-in full defiance of Mrs.&#xD;
IQerrick's presence. After that, however, Mr. Linden-to&#xD;
do him justice.-did change the subject.&#xD;
Cowslips and coffee went on well till near the end of&#xD;
breakfast, which to say truth had been rather prolonged as&#xD;
well as delayed; and then there came a front door knock.&#xD;
It was of no use for Faith to start, for breakfast was not&#xD;
absolutely finished; and the next minute who should come&#xD;
in from the hall but Miss Es~ie de Staff. As fresh as pos~&#xD;
sible, in white dress and black silk apron; her black hair&#xD;
from which she had drawn off the sunbonnet, in shining&#xD;
order; the black eyes as well! Perhaps they dilated on&#xD;
first seeing the party; more sparkling they could not be.&#xD;
She advanced at a moderate pace towards the table, look-&#xD;
ing and speaking.&#xD;
"Mrs. Derrick !.-I didn't know you were such late peo-&#xD;
ple. I have come to run away with your daughter, and&#xD;
thought I should find the coast clear. Mr. Linden! I didn't&#xD;
know Pattaquasset was so happy as to have you back, sir."&#xD;
"We have breakfast late for Faith's sake," said Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick, while Mr. Linden rose and gave the lady first his&#xD;
hand and. then a chair, remarking that the happiness of&#xD;
Pattaquasset was pleasant news to him too.&#xD;
"But Faith's well again, isn't she ?" said Miss Essie,&#xD;
waiting to get breath, mentally.&#xD;

falling in, love with ladies, Mr. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I have more knowledge of gentlemen's possibilities,&#xD;
Who is supposed to be in danger7 Miss Essie ?"&#xD;
"Faith cannot go out to spend the day," said Mrs. Per.&#xD;
said Miss Essie. "Mrs. Derrick, why&#xD;
rick decidedly.&#xD;
me? Faith, won't you go ?".-She had&#xD;
the                  Faith's side, Wlioni&#xD;
her eyes were now reading, or at least endeavouring to&#xD;
spell out.&#xD;
"Not to-day, Miss Essie, thank you."&#xD;
the whole table. "Here will be Sophy and me horribly dis-&#xD;
"Thank me? you ought to apologize to me." Miss&#xD;
Essie took a chair in that place, where she could "rake"&#xD;
appointed. We had counted on you. Sophy is all alone.&#xD;
You know, Faith, the doctor is laid up ?"&#xD;
II~       "We heard of it,"-Faith answered, not very easily.&#xD;
"Well, do you know he says he is going South ?"&#xD;
"I heard so," said Faith. Miss Essie could not make&#xD;
much of the rising colour in her cheeks, it came and ~vent&#xD;
so easily!&#xD;
"What takes him off just now in such haste ?-.business?"&#xD;
Faith looked up and ave her inquisitor a full clear look,&#xD;
such as curiosity never ares for, while she answered with&#xD;
quiet dignity, "He did not tell me, Miss Essie."&#xD;
"It's a pity Dr. Harrison's just going now that you're&#xD;
just come," said the lady of the black eyes, shifting her&#xD;
ground. "You used to be such friends."&#xD;
"What is a friend ?" said Mr. Linden-" By the way,&#xD;
Miss Essie, you should make these crosses an excuse for at&#xD;
least eating salt with us, and so prove your title to the&#xD;
name."&#xD;
"Dear me !" said the lady taking a handful,-" I thought&#xD;
a friend was something more-more ethereal than that P&#xD;
&#xD;
j    "Than what, if you please ?"&#xD;
"A person who eats your salt !-I don't love crosses. I&#xD;
am not one of Nebuchadnezzar's family. Where did you&#xD;
get the fashion? It's French. Dr. Harrison eats them.&#xD;
Did he teach it to you, Faith ?"&#xD;
"I think I had that honour," said' Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"I dare say you gave more lessons than were given in&#xD;
~ said Miss Essie significantly. "What else did you&#xD;
learn of him, Faith ?"&#xD;
Faith gave the lady only a glance of her soft eye, but&#xD;
her face and her very throat were charged with varying&#xD;
colour. 'Her attention went from crosses to cowslips.&#xD;
"I am saucy !" said the lady.-" Mr. Linden, are you&#xD;
coming back to the bona fide school here? there'll be a&#xD;
great many glad."&#xD;
A very involuntary lesson to Miss Essie herself came&#xD;
longingly to Mr. Linden's lips, but except from the slight&#xD;
play and compression of the same she had not the benefit&#xD;
of it. He spoke as usual.&#xD;
"She has never learned the art of self-defence, Miss&#xD;
; Essie, therefore I pray you attack me. No, I am not&#xD;
coming back to the school-and to say truth, I think there&#xD;
would be some people sorry-as well as glad-if I did."&#xD;
"Your bad scholars ?"-said the lady, not intent upon&#xD;
~. her question.&#xD;
"No-my good friends."&#xD;
"I should be glad," said Miiss Essie. "Who are your&#xD;
friends that would be sorry? Dr. Harrison, for instance ?"&#xD;
"The friends who like my present work better."&#xD;
"And you are going to be a clergyman ?" said Miss&#xD;
~ Essie, leaning her elbow on the table and 'studying' Mr.&#xD;
Linden, perhaps some other things too, with her eyes.&#xD;
I[e smiled under the scrutiny, but merely bowed to her&#xD;
question.&#xD;
"It's dreadful hard work !-" said Miss Essie.&#xD;
"Dreadful ?-Miss Essie, you have not studied the sub~&#xD;
ject."&#xD;
"No," said she laughing,-" I said 'dreadful hard.' And&#xD;
so it is, I think."&#xD;

work?" said Mr. Linden, making one or two quiet addi.&#xD;
tions to the breakfast on Faith's plate. Which means ~&#xD;
assistance Faith inadvertently disregarded and pushed her&#xD;
plate away.&#xD;
"Do you suppose anyboffy delights in them?" said Miss&#xD;
Essie. "J can't understand it-but perhaps they do. ~&#xD;
minister is very much looked up to. But one thing is Cei~.&#xD;
tain-of all things the hardest, it is to be a minister's wife !"&#xD;
"Of all things! He must be a poor sort of a minister&#xD;
who lets his wife have a harder life than his own."&#xD;
"He can't help it-" said Miss Essie, walking herbiack&#xD;
eyes about. "Of course he don't wish it-but Women&#xD;
always do have a harder time than men, and a minister's&#xD;
wife particularly."&#xD;
"It's a comfort to think he don't wish it," said Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den with a sort of resigned gravity.&#xD;
"Well it would not be much comfort to me," said Miss&#xD;
Essie. "When a woman marries, she naturally expects her&#xD;
husband to belong to her;- but a minister belongs to&#xD;
everybody else !"&#xD;
"I see I have not studied the subject," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Miss Essie, you are giving me most important informa-&#xD;
tion. Is this so inevitable that I ought in conscience to&#xD;
warn the lady beforehand ?"&#xD;
Miss Essie smiled graciously. "It would be no ,-~&#xD;
she wouldn't believe you. I might warn her. I have&#xD;
seen it."&#xD;
"What have you seen ?"&#xD;
"Why that !-.---that a woman who marries a minister&#xD;
needn't expect to have any more of her husband than his&#xD;
clothes to mend."&#xD;
"Melancholy statement !" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"It's of no use to tell it to a man I" said Miss Essie.&#xD;
"But I have seen it."&#xD;
"Not in my house."&#xD;
"I shall see it in your house, if you ever let me in there&#xD;
-but it will be too late to warn then. Very likely you will&#xD;
not see it."&#xD;
Faith sat with one hand shielding hei' face from this&#xD;
speaker, though by that means it was more fully revealed to&#xD;
the other. Her other hand, and her eyesas far as possible,&#xD;
&#xD;
were lost in the bunch of cowslips; her colour had long&#xD;
ceased to be varying. She sat still as a mouse.&#xD;
"No, I shall not see it. To what end would your warn-&#xD;
ings be directed, if they could reach her in time ?"&#xD;
"To keep her from taking such a trying position."&#xD;
"Oh-" said Mr. Linden. "Have you no feeling for&#xD;
me, Miss Essie? It is very plain why you scrupled to eat&#xD;
salt with me this morning !"&#xD;
"I'll eat salt with you as a single man," said Miss&#xD;
Essie,-" but if you are going to be a minister, be gener-&#xD;
ous, and let your wife go! Any other woman will tell&#xD;
you 50.~'&#xD;
"Let her go where? With me - that is just what I&#xD;
intend."&#xD;
"Yes," said Miss Essie,.-" and then-you'll never know&#xD;
it-but she will sit alone up stairs and sew while you are&#xD;
writing your sermons, and she'll sit down stairs and sew&#xD;
while you're riding about the country or walking about the&#xD;
~ town; and she'll go out alone of your errands when you&#xD;
have a cold that keeps you at home; and the only time she&#xD;
hears you speal~ will be when you speak in the pulpit! And&#xD;
if you ask her whether she is happy, she will say yes !-."&#xD;
Despite all her desperate confusion, the one visible&#xD;
corner of Faith's month showed rebellion against order.&#xD;
Mr. Linden laughed with most unterrified amusement.&#xD;
"If she says that, it will be so, Miss Essie - my wife&#xD;
will be a most uncompromising truth-teller. But in your&#xD;
picture I am the one to be pitied. Will she never sit on&#xD;
the same floor with me under any circumstances ?"&#xD;
"More than you deserve !" said Miss Essie. "You to be&#xD;
pitied, indeed! You know the man has the stir, and the&#xD;
talk, and the going from place to place, and the being&#xD;
looked up to, and the having everybody at his feet; and&#xD;
~ what has she?"&#xD;
Mr. Linden did not answer, even with his eyes, which&#xD;
were looking down; and the smile which came at Miss&#xD;
J~ssie's last words, was clearly not meant for her. His wife&#xD;
would have something-so it said and asserted,-and his&#xD;
wire was not an indefinite, imaginary person,-it said that&#xD;
too. And she was worth all that could be laid at her feet.&#xD;
How much he had to lay there.~-~what homage his homage&#xD;

&#xD;
was-even of this the face gave unconscious token. M~~~&#xD;
Essie looked, and read it or at least felt it, much mole&#xD;
than she could well have put into words. Then taking in&#xD;
review Faith's bowed head, she turned and spoke in quite&#xD;
a different tone.&#xD;
"There is no use in talking to people, Mrs. Derrick,&#xD;
After all, mayn't I have Faith ?"&#xD;
"To spend the day? Oh no, Miss Essie !-she's not&#xD;
strong enough," said Mrs. Derrick, rising from the table&#xD;
and beginning to put the cups together. Faith left the&#xD;
party and went to the lire, whid~ in the advanced state ~&#xD;
the May morning needed no tending.&#xD;
"Yet she must spend the day somewhere," said Miss&#xD;
Essie wheeling round. "Faith !.-what are you going to&#xD;
do with yourself?"&#xD;
"Nothing, Miss Essie,".-came softly from the fire.&#xD;
mender. But as her hand moved to and fro with the tongs,&#xD;
the sparkle of the diamonds caught Miss Essie's eye.&#xD;
"Child ! .-.-how did you get that?" she exclaimed,&#xD;
springing to her side and arresting the tongs. Faith's low&#xD;
"I don't know, ma'am".-.was inimitable. It was well&#xD;
neither lady had sight of Mr. Linden's face.&#xD;
"It's very beautiful I" said Miss Essie, controlling herself&#xD;
into some order, and poring over the little hand she had&#xD;
made captive. "I never saw a greater beauty of a ring-.&#xD;
never. Do you know what it means, Faith ?" She dropped&#xD;
her voice and tapped significantly the finger.&#xD;
Faith answered like a person put to the question,-&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Do you ?" said Miss Essie in the same low aside and&#xD;
half laughing. "I am so glad. I always thought it.&#xD;
]3ut this is splendid, Faith. You don't know how handsome&#xD;
it is. It is easy to know where this came from. I needn't&#xD;
ask."&#xD;
"I must ask you both to sit down," said Mr. Lind en,-&#xD;
"Faith is not strong enough for much standing, Miss Essie."&#xD;
"I can't sit down-I'm going away," said the lady. "I'll&#xD;
tell~Sophy she may expect you the first day you can go out&#xD;
for so long,"-she went on renewing her half whisper to&#xD;
Faith. "Does she know of this ?"-touching the diamonds&#xD;
which Miss Essie had not yet let go.&#xD;
&#xD;
"N6, Miss Essie-." Faith stood in great confusion. Mr.&#xD;
Linden left the table, and gently disengaging her from Miss&#xD;
Essie placed her in the great chair, and stood resting one&#xD;
hand on the back of it.&#xD;
"Miss Essie," he said, "Faith belongs to me-.--and there-&#xD;
fore if I take care of her strength in a somewhat summary&#xD;
way, you will forgive me."&#xD;
Miss Essie paused and looked at him in most bewildering&#xD;
confusion. ile had spoken and she had heard, very clearly.&#xD;
"I don't believe it !"-she said with an attempt at jocu-&#xD;
1a~ity in which there mingled somehow, inexplicably, a&#xD;
quality that was not pleasure. "Faith !-no double-deal-&#xD;
ing. Two is too much."&#xD;
"Or even the suggestion of two," Mr. Linden said.&#xD;
"Do you mean," said Miss Essie looking at him with a&#xD;
semi-comical endeavour to cover up discomfiture and other&#xD;
things-"do you mean to say that I have made' nothing&#xD;
here but an abominable mistake ?"&#xD;
"I should give it a different adjective."&#xD;
Miss Essie made a despairing gesture. "Oh !-I might&#xD;
well say it's no use talking to people! Will you ever for-&#xD;
give me, Mr. Linden, for all the mischief I have tried to do&#xD;
you? I didn't know both parties were within hearing of&#xD;
me, you know, sir ?.-"&#xD;
"Miss Essie, I hope you may always be as successful."&#xD;
Perhaps Miss Essie wondered, as she glanced at Faith,&#xD;
~whether she had done any 'mischief' or no; but she ven-&#xD;
tured no sort of repartee, being altogether in an uncomfort-&#xD;
able and somewhat awed state of mind. She made hurried&#xD;
adicus to Mrs. Derrick, more formal and extremely civil&#xD;
leave-taking of Mr. Linden, parted in a sort of astonished&#xD;
wise with Faith and the diamonds which evidently bewile-&#xD;
dered her yet, and made what was also evidently an escape&#xD;
out of the house. While Mr. Linden attended the lady to&#xD;
the door, Faith softly and swiftly passed behind them and&#xD;
made her escape too, up stairs. She was gone before he'&#xD;
turned.&#xD;
It was perhaps an hour after this, when Cindy entered&#xD;
Faith's room and gave her a note. "I'm free to confess,"&#xD;
said Cindy, "that Mr. Lindemi gave it to me, but who writ&#xD;
it 11 don't know." But Faith did. It ran thus :-&#xD;

"Mademoiselle-With great impatience I have waited&#xD;
for my Sunbeam to break through the gloomy clouds of&#xD;
doubt which surround me - but I perceive the 'warning'&#xD;
has taken effect!&#xD;
In keeping with this is~ the state of the outer world&#xD;
which is even rainy ! -so that my purpose to take said&#xD;
Sunbeam out to drive is for the present thwarted.&#xD;
Conceive of my state of mind!&#xD;
In vain I repeat to myself the comforting truth, that my&#xD;
Sunbeam is shining somewhere, if not on me, there are&#xD;
circumstances where philosophical truths lose all their&#xD;
power.&#xD;
I remember that the 'warning' contained some notable&#xD;
mistakes,-as for instance, that I should ever-my pen re.&#xD;
fuses to write the words !-or I do. As ~vell might it be&#xD;
said that I should -~. Mademoiselle, you must perceive&#xD;
the obvious bearing of these two upon each other.&#xD;
If your interest in the writer has carried you so far, per.&#xD;
haps he may indulge the hope that at some future time it&#xD;
may carry you further-even to the head of the stairs-.&#xD;
where it is needless to say you will be received with open~&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
It is also needless to sign this-it could come from but&#xD;
one person !"&#xD;
Some two minutes after, Faith's room door opened, and&#xD;
a very flashing bright sunbeam came out upon the place&#xD;
indicated, only a little peachblossom tinge in her cheeks&#xD;
witnessing to any consciousness. She was met according&#xD;
to promise-then held off and looked at with serio-comic ey~s~&#xD;
"What a cruel child you are !" Mr. Linden said.&#xD;
"What do you want, Endecott ?" said Faith trying to be&#xD;
serious.&#xD;
"low can you have the heart to sit up stairs and sew&#xD;
while I am down stairs in my study ?"&#xD;
Faith instantly came so close, taking the nearest refuge,&#xD;
that he could not very well see her face; but that she was&#xD;
laughing still he knew.&#xD;
"Endecott !-don't talk so. I didn't know where you&#xD;
were."&#xD;
"Will it be in this sort of weather that you will 'go out&#xD;
to do errands' and leave me at home ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"I~udecott !-If you don't want anything more of me,"&#xD;
said Faith lifting up' a face which was an array of peach-&#xD;
blossoms,-" I'll go back again.~~&#xD;
"Will you ?-" with a little tightening of his hold, and&#xD;
signification of his approval of peacliblossoms. "Faith,&#xD;
you are a lovely child I Will it distress you very much if&#xD;
II go off and ride about the country alone ?"&#xD;
But noW,-Seeing she could not get away,-she stood-&#xD;
graver; and the answer was very gentle, almost tender-&#xD;
"Then you will not confess that you were frightened out&#xD;
of your wits at the picture ?" said Mr. Linden smiling,&#xD;
though with an answering change of tone.&#xD;
"Did you think I was&#xD;
"No-you are too much of a woman for that, even if you&#xD;
had believed it true."&#xD;
"Then you were not frightened ?-.-" she said with some&#xD;
comicality.&#xD;
"I? desperately I-my note did not give you any idea of&#xD;
the state of my mind! Imagine me sitting down stairs and&#xD;
saying to myself.-(words naturally suggested by the state&#xD;
of the weather)-.&#xD;
'0 how this spring of love resembleth&#xD;
Th' uncertain glories of an April day,&#xD;
Which now shews all the beauties of the sun,&#xD;
And by and by a cloud takes all away!"'&#xD;
One of the soft flashes of Faith's eye came first to an-&#xD;
swer him; and then she remarked very coolly, (N.B. her&#xD;
face was not so,) "I think it will clearat noon, Endecott."&#xD;
"Do you ?" he said looking towards the window with a&#xD;
counterfeit surprise that was in comical antithesis to his&#xD;
last words,-" does it rain still I"&#xD;
Faith's eye came back quick from the window to him,&#xD;
and then, for the first time in many a long day, her old&#xD;
mellow sweet laugh rolled over the subject, dismissing&#xD;
make-believes and figures of speech in its clear matter-of-&#xD;
fact rejoicing.&#xD;
"My dear little Miguonette I" Mr. Linden said, "that&#xD;
does my very heart good. You are really getting better,&#xD;
in spite of lessons and warnings, and all other hindrances.&#xD;

was smoothing and arranging her hair as he spoke-hjs&#xD;
look one that nobody but Faith ever had from Mr. Linden,&#xD;

before him, so still and silent as if she might have had&#xD;

her attitude, the very power of her silence, contradicted&#xD;
that, and testified as well to the grace of a grave and most&#xD;
exquisite humility which clothed her from head to foot.&#xD;
Mr. Linden was as silent as she, watching her; but then&#xD;
he drew her off to the low couch in the wide old-fashioned&#xD;
entry window, and seated her there in a very bath of spring&#xD;
air and struggling sunbeams.&#xD;
"I suppose it is useless to say 'Please give me yours',"&#xD;
he said smiling. "Mignonette, we have had no reading&#xD;
to-day----.do you like this time and place ?.-and shall it be&#xD;
with you or to you?"&#xD;
*       "It will be both, won't it ?" said Faith; and she went&#xD;
*     for her Bible.&#xD;
&#xD;
OIIAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
TfIIE day was struggling into clearness by the time dinner&#xD;
was over. Patches of blue sky looked down through&#xD;
grey, vapoury, scattering clouds; while now and then a few&#xD;
rain drops fell to keel) up the character of the morning,&#xD;
and broad warm genial sunbeams fell between them. It&#xD;
was not fair yet for a drive; and Mr. Linden went out on&#xD;
some errands of business, leaving Faith with a charge to&#xD;
sleep and rest and be ready against his return.&#xD;
lie was but a little while gone when Jem Waters made&#xD;
his appearance and asked for Faith. Mr. Simlins had been&#xD;
ill-that Faith knew-but Jem brought a sad report of&#xD;
how ill he had been, and a message that he was "tired of&#xD;
not seeing Faith and wished she would let ~Jem fetch her&#xD;
down. She might go back again as soon as she'd a mind&#xD;
to." lie wanted to see her "real bad," according to Jem;&#xD;
for he had ordered the best wagon on the premises to be&#xD;
cleaned and harnessed up, and the best buffalo robe put in,&#xD;
and charged Jem to bring Miss Faith "if she could any-&#xD;
ways come." And there was Jem and the wagon.&#xD;
Faith demurred; she had not had her sleep and didn't&#xD;
know, or rather did know, how the proceeding would be&#xD;
looked upon; but she also fancied more meaning in the&#xD;
summons than Jem had been commissioned to make known.&#xD;
And perhaps another little wee feminine thought came in.&#xD;
to help her decision.&#xD;
"Mother," she said, "I shall go. You need not say&#xD;
anything about it unless you are asked. It isn't far to Mr.&#xD;
Simlins'-I shall be home in time for my ride." So, quickly&#xD;
ready, Jem drove her down.&#xD;
Mr. Simlins she found sitting up, in a nondescript inva-&#xD;
lid's attire of an old cloak and a summer waistcoat; and&#xD;
warm as the day was, with a little fire burning, which was&#xD;
not unnecessary to correct the damp of the unused sitting-&#xD;
room. He was, as he said, "fallen away considerable, and&#xD;

with no more strength than a spring chicken," but for the&#xD;
rest looked as usual. And so spoke.&#xD;
"Well,-why haint you been to see me before ?"&#xD;
"I have been sick, sir."&#xD;
"Sick ?" said he~ his voice softening unconsciously to.~&#xD;
wards her sweet tones. "Sit there and let me see.-1&#xD;
believe you have. But you aint fur from well now !" lie&#xD;
had some reason, for the face he had turned to the sunlight&#xD;
bore all the quiet lines of happiness, and its somewhat faint&#xD;
colour was replaced under his scrutiny by a conscious deep&#xD;
rose.&#xD;
"Don't you know," said he settling himself back in his&#xD;
chair, -" I don't think I see the sun and moon when I don't&#xD;
see you? Or the moon, anyways-you aint but the half&#xD;
of my Zodiack."&#xD;
"What did you want to see the moon for, Mr. Simlins ?"&#xD;
said Faith willing to interrupt him.&#xD;
"Well.-you see, I've been a kind of a latudinarian&#xD;
too," said Mr. Simlins doubtfully..-" It pulls a man's mind&#xD;
down; as well as his flesh-and I got tired of thinking' to..&#xD;
day and concluded J'd send for you to stxp it." His look&#xD;
confessed more than his words. Faith had little need to&#xD;
ask what he had been thinking about.&#xD;
"What shall I do to stop it, sir ?"&#xD;
"Well, you can read-can't you ?-or talk to me."&#xD;
There was a strange uneasy wandering of his eye, and a&#xD;
corresponding unwanted simplicity and directness in his&#xD;
talk. Faith noted both and silently went for a Bible she&#xD;
saw lying on a table. She brought it to Mr. Simlins' side&#xD;
and opened its pages slQwly, questioning with herself where&#xD;
she should read. Some association of a long past conver-&#xD;
sation perhaps was present with her, for though she paused&#xD;
over one and another of several passages, she could fix&#xD;
upon none but the parable of the unfruitful tree.&#xD;
"Do you mean that for me ?" said the farmer a minute&#xD;
after she had done.&#xD;
"Yes sir-and no, dear Mr. Simlins !" said Faith look-&#xD;
ing up.&#xD;
"Why is it. 'yes' and 'no'? how be I like that ?"-he&#xD;
growled, but with a certain softening and lowering of his&#xD;
growl.&#xD;
&#xD;
"The good trees all do the work they were made for.&#xD;
God calls for the same from us," Faith said gently.&#xD;
"I know what you're thinking' of~," said he ;-" but haint&#xD;
I done it? Who ever heerd a man say I had wronged&#xD;
him ~ or that I have been hal-hearted either ~ I nev~'&#xD;
It was curious how he let his thoughts out to her; but&#xD;
the very gentle, pure and true face beside him provoked&#xD;
~neither controversy, nor mistrust, nor pride. He spoke to&#xD;
her as if she had only been a child. Like a child, with&#xD;
~aoh sympathy and simplicity, she answered him.&#xD;
"Mr. Simlins, the Bible says that 'the fruits of right-&#xD;
eousness are by Jesus Christ. '-Do you know him ?-are&#xD;
you in his service ?"&#xD;
"I don't know as I understand you," said he.&#xD;
"I can't make you understand it, sir."&#xD;
"Why can't you? who can ?" said he quickly.&#xD;
"It is written, Mr. Simlins,-' They shall be all taught&#xD;
of God."'-She she wed him the place. "And it is writ-&#xD;
ten, 'Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,&#xD;
and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach&#xD;
us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. '-That is it.&#xD;
If you are willing to walk iu his paths, he will shew them&#xD;
to you." Faith looked eagerly at the farmer, and he&#xD;
looked at her. Neither heart was hid from the other.&#xD;
"But supposing' I was willin'-which I be, so fur's I know&#xD;
-I don't know what they be no more'n a child. How am&#xD;
I goin' to find 'em out?"&#xD;
Faith's eyes filled quick as she turned over the leaves&#xD;
again ;-.-was it by sympathy alone that occasion came for&#xD;
the rough hand to pass once or twice hastily across those&#xD;
that were looking at her? Without speaking, Faith showed&#xD;
him the words,-" If any man will do his will, he shall&#xD;
know of the doctrine."&#xD;
"That is the question, dear Mr. Simlins. On that 'if'&#xD;
it all hangs." The farmer took the book into his own&#xD;
hands and sat looking steadily at the words.&#xD;
"Well," said he putting it back on her lap-" supposia'&#xD;
the 'if' '5 all right-Go ahead, Faith."&#xD;
"Then the way is clear for you to do that; and it's all&#xD;

easy. But the first thing is here.-the invitation of Jesus&#xD;
himself."&#xD;
"Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,&#xD;
and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and&#xD;
learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye&#xD;
shall find rest unto your souls. For my yoke is easy, and&#xD;
my burden is light."&#xD;
"You see," she went on very gently,-" he bids yo~&#xD;
learn of him-so he is ready to teach you. If you are&#xD;
only willing to take his yoke upon you,-to be his servant&#xD;
and own it,.-he will shew you what to do, step by step,&#xD;
and help you in every one.~7&#xD;
"I don't see where's the beginning of the way yet," said&#xD;
the farmer.&#xD;
"That," said Faith. "Be the servant of Jesus Christ&#xD;
and own it; and then go to him for all you want. He is&#xD;
good for all."&#xD;
There was a pause.&#xD;
"I s'pose you've been goin' on in that way a good&#xD;
while."&#xD;
"A good while-yes, "-Faith almost whispered.&#xD;
"Well, when you are goin' to him sometimes, ask some~.&#xD;
thin' for me,.-will you ?"&#xD;
He had bent over, leaning on his knees, to speak it in a&#xD;
lower growl than ordinary. Faith bowed her head at first,&#xD;
unwilling to speak; but tears somehow started, and the&#xD;
drpps followed each other, as she sat gazing into the black&#xD;
flreplace,.-she could not help it-till a perfect shower of&#xD;
weeping brought her face into her hands and stirred her&#xD;
not very strong frame. It stirred the farmer, robust as he&#xD;
was in spite of illness; he shifted his chair most uneasily,&#xD;
and finally laid down his head on his folded arms on the&#xD;
table. Faith was the first to speak.&#xD;
"Mr. Simlins, who takes care of you ?"&#xD;
"Ugh !" (a most unintelligible grunt,) "they all do it by&#xD;
turns-Jenny and all of 'em."&#xD;
"What have you had for dinner to-day ?"&#xD;
"Didn't want anything !" He sat up and brushed his&#xD;
cloak sleeve across his forehead.&#xD;
"Mr. Simlins, I shall send you down something from&#xD;
home and you must eat it."&#xD;
&#xD;
"The doctor said I was to take wine-but I haint thought&#xD;
of it to-day."&#xD;
"W'here is. it?"&#xD;
He nodded his head in the direction, of the, cupboard.&#xD;
Faith went rummaging, poured him out a glass and&#xD;
brought it.&#xD;
"You see," said he after he had taken it-"J've been&#xD;
pretty well pulled down-I didn't know-one time-which&#xD;
side of the fence I was goin' over-and I didn't see the&#xD;
ground on the other side. I don't know why I should be&#xD;
ashamed to say I was afeard !"-There was a strong, stern,&#xD;
truth-telling about this speech that thrilled his hearer. She&#xD;
sat down again.&#xD;
"You had best take some yourself," he said. "Do&#xD;
Faith !"&#xD;
"No sir-.-.I'm going. I must go," she answered rising&#xD;
to make ready.&#xD;
It was strange how the door could have opened and she&#xD;
not heard it-neither she nor Mr. Simlins in fact,-perhaps&#xD;
because their minds were so far away. That the incoming&#xD;
steps were unheard was not so strange, nor new, but the&#xD;
first thing of which Faith was conscious was the soft touch&#xD;
of a hand on either side of her face-she was a prisoner.&#xD;
Faith's instant spring to one side brought her face to face&#xD;
~rith everybody. Mr. Simhins looked from one to the&#xD;
other, and his first remark was characteristically addressed&#xD;
to Faith.&#xD;
"Why you didn't tell me that!"&#xD;
"Has she told you everything but that ?" said Mr. Lin~&#xD;
den smiling, and giving the farmer's hand good token of&#xD;
his presence.&#xD;
"Where under the sun did you come from ?" said the&#xD;
farmer returning his grasp with interest, and looking at&#xD;
Mr. Linden as if indeed one of the lights of the solar sys~&#xD;
tem had been out before his arrival. Faith sat down&#xD;
mutely and as quietly as possible behind Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"From under the sun very literally just now-before&#xD;
that from under a shower. I have been down to Quapaw,&#xD;
then home to Mrs. Derrick's, then here. Mr. Siinhins, I&#xD;
am sorry to see that you are nursing yourself instead of&#xD;
me. What is the matter ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"I'd as lives be doin' this, of the two," said the farmer&#xD;
with a stray smile. "There aint much the matter. IJo~&#xD;
long have you been in this meridian ?"&#xD;
"Two days." And stepping from before Faith, Mr.&#xD;
Linden asked her "if she had come there in a dream ?"&#xD;
"Do you ever see such good-loohin' things in your&#xD;
dreams ?" said the farmer. "My visual pictures are all&#xD;
broken down fences, or Jem or Jenny doin' something' they&#xD;
haint ought to do. How long're you goin' to stay in Pat.&#xD;
taquasset, Dominie ?"&#xD;
"Some time, I hope. Not quite so long as the first&#xD;
time, but longer than I have bcen since that. Do you&#xD;
know, Mr. Simlins, your coat collar* is a little bit turned&#xD;
in ?-.--and why don't you give the sunshine a better web&#xD;
come ?-.you two sick people together want some one to&#xD;
make a stir for you." Which office Mr. Linden took upon&#xD;
himself-lightly disengaging the collar, and then going to&#xD;
the window to draw up the shade and throw back the shut.&#xD;
ters,.-stopping on his way back to straighten the table&#xD;
cover, and followed by a full gush of sunlight from the&#xD;
window.&#xD;
"It is so glorious this afternoon !" he said. And stand-&#xD;
ing silent a moment in that brilliant band of lignt-looking&#xD;
out at the world all glittering and sparkling in the sun,&#xD;
Mr. Linden repeated,-" 'Unto you that fear my name,&#xD;
shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, with healing in his&#xD;
wings.'-~What a promise that is P'&#xD;
"Where did you get those words ?"-said Mr. Simlins,&#xD;
after the sunlight and the silence had given them their full&#xD;
effect.&#xD;
"From the Bible-God's book of promises. Do you&#xD;
want to see the place ?"&#xD;
Mr. Simlins turned down a corner of the leaf and laid&#xD;
the book, still open, on the table. Then looked at Mr.&#xD;
Linden with a mixture of pleasure and humour in his eyes.&#xD;
"Are you any nearer bein' a minister than. you was a year&#xD;
ago ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Nearer in one way. But I cannot lay claim to the&#xD;
title you gave me for another year yet, Mr. Simlins."&#xD;
"You're Say and Seal as much as ever. What more&#xD;
fixin' have you got to do ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"A little finishing," said Mr. Linden with a smile.&#xD;
And he got up and went for Faith's shawl and gloves&#xD;
which were on the table. Mr. Simlins watched the shawl.&#xD;
ing and gloving with attention.&#xD;
"You can tell Jem he won't be wanted again, Faith," he&#xD;
said. "I guess you'll see him at the gate." Mr. Linden&#xD;
smiled, but some other thought was on his mind,--.the face&#xD;
that he turned to Mr. Simlins showed concern that was&#xD;
both grave and kind.&#xD;
"What can I do for you?" he said.&#xD;
This aint the prettiest place in Pattaquasset; but maybe&#xD;
you'll come and see rue sometimes-till I can get out my-&#xD;
self," Mr. Simlins said considerately.&#xD;
"You may be sure I will. And will you let me pray&#xD;
with you now, before I go ?"&#xD;
The farmer hesitated-or was silent-one instant, then&#xD;
with a sort of subdued abruptness said,&#xD;
"I'm ready!"-&#xD;
They knelt there in the sunlight; hut when the prayer&#xD;
was over Mr. Simlins felt half puzzled to know for whose&#xD;
sake it had been proposed. For with the telling of his&#xD;
doubts and hindrances and wants-things which he had&#xD;
told to no one, there mingled so much of the speaker's own&#xD;
interest,-wh~~h could not be content to leave him but in&#xD;
Christ's hands.&#xD;
There was not a word spoken after that for a minute,-.&#xD;
Mr. Linden stood by the low mantelpiece resting his face&#xD;
on his hand. The farmer, busy with the feelings which the&#xD;
prayer had raised, sat with downcast eyes. And Faith&#xD;
was motionless with a deep and manifold sense of happi-&#xD;
ness, the labyrinth of which herself could not soon have&#xD;
threaded out. The silence and stillness of his two com-&#xD;
panions drew the farmer's eyes up; he read first, with an&#xD;
eager eye that nobody saw, the sweet gravity on on~ half&#xD;
hidden face, and the deep pure joy written in all the lines&#xD;
of the other; and secret and strong, though half unknown&#xD;
to hirnselg the whole tide of his heart turned that way. If&#xD;
not before, then at least, something 'like Ruth's resolution&#xD;
came up within him ;-" thy people shall be my people, and&#xD;
thy God my God !" Mr. Linden was the first one that&#xD;
moved.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Are you ready, dear child ?"&#xD;
The farmer's eyes were on her too, even while he wrung&#xD;
Mr. Linden's hand. But he only said before he let it go,.~.&#xD;
"Give a glass of wine to her when she gets home."&#xD;
Out in the sweet afternoon air, and driving through the&#xD;
gate which opened on the highway, with Jein Waters on&#xD;
hand to shut it, Mr. Linden brought Faith's face round&#xD;
toward&amp;amp; him and scanned it earnestly.&#xD;
"My child, how tired you are! I wish I knew whether&#xD;
it would do you most good to go straight home, or to&#xD;
breathe this air a little longer."&#xD;
"I hope you won't conclude to take me home," said&#xD;
Faith. "I have been looking for this all day.&#xD;
"Do you think you deserve to have it ?" said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
turning Jerry's head however the way that was not straight&#xD;
home. "Why didn't you sleep, and wait for me to bring&#xD;
you down here ?"&#xD;
"One reason was, Endy, that I half guessed Mr. Simlins&#xD;
wanted to talk to me and that it might be better for him to&#xD;
see one than two.&#xD;
"I could have left you there for a while."&#xD;
"No you couldn't!" she said. "And I couldn't have&#xD;
driven off Jerry and left you-.-though that would have been&#xD;
better."&#xD;
"You could have driven me off. What was the other&#xD;
reason ?"&#xD;
"The other reason isn't really worth your hearing.&#xD;
Don't you think this afternoon is too pretty to spoil with&#xD;
bad reasons ?".-.she said with gentle eyes, half fun, half&#xD;
confession.&#xD;
"Entirely. Faith I think you Would bear the ride&#xD;
better if you had a sort of afternoon lunch,-....shall we stop&#xD;
at Miss Bezac's for a glass of milk ?"&#xD;
"Oh no !".-.she said hastily. "Oh no, Endecott! I&#xD;
don't want anything but to ride."&#xD;
"And to hide-)' said Mr. Linden laughingly. "Another&#xD;
bad reason, Faith ?"&#xD;
She gave him a little blushing look, very frank and&#xD;
happy, that also bore homage to his penetration.&#xD;
"Stop anywhere you please,. Endy," she said honestly.&#xD;
"I was very glad you came to Mr. Simlins'."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Would you rather get it from Mrs. Davids ?" he inquired&#xD;
demurely.&#xD;
"No, not rather. Whichever you like, End ecott," Faith&#xD;
5aid, hiding the start which the question in this real form&#xD;
gave her. The afternoon sun through which they were&#xD;
riding was very bright; the washed leaves were brilliantly&#xD;
green; sweet scents of trees and buds filled the air, and&#xD;
opening apple blossoms were scattering beauty all over the&#xD;
land. Nothing could spoil that afternoon. Faith had a&#xD;
secret consciousness besides that the very thing from which&#xD;
she shrank was by no mean disagreeable to Mr. Linden.&#xD;
She did not care what he did! And he,.-in the joy of&#xD;
being with her, of seeing her grow stronger every hour, Mr.&#xD;
Linden was in a 'holiday humour'.--in the mood for work&#xD;
or play or mischief; and took the road to Miss Bezac's for&#xD;
more than a glass of milk.&#xD;
"Mign onette," he said, "what varieties of pride do you&#xD;
consider lawful and becoming?"&#xD;
"I know only a few innocent sorts," said Faith,-"that&#xD;
I keep for myself."&#xD;
"Luxurious child! 'A few innocent sorts of pride that&#xD;
you keep for yourself'! You must divide with me."&#xD;
How Faith laughed.&#xD;
"You wouldn't thank me for one of them all, Endecott.&#xD;
And yet-" She stopped, and coloured brilliantly on the&#xD;
sudden.&#xD;
"Explain and finish," said Mr. Linden laconically.&#xD;
"If I told you what they are you would laugh at me."&#xD;
"That would not hurt mc. What are they, Mi~nonette ?"&#xD;
She spoke gravely, though smiling sonietlines; answer-&#xD;
ing to the matter of fact, as she had been asked. "I am&#xD;
proud, a little, of very fine rolls of butter, or a particularly&#xD;
good cheese. I think ii am proud of my carnations, and&#xD;
perhaps-" she went on colouring-" of being so good a&#xD;
baker as I am. And perhaps-I think I am-of such&#xD;
things as sewing and dressmaking; -but I don't think&#xD;
there is much harm in all that. I know myself sometimes&#xD;
proud of other things, where I know it is wrong."&#xD;
"how do you know but I am proud of your rolls of&#xD;
butter too ?" said Mr. Linden looking amused. "But&#xD;
Miguonette, what called forth such a display of the carna~&#xD;
&#xD;

822               ~AY AND SEAL.                                    SAY AND SEAL.              ~23.&#xD;
&#xD;
lions you are not proud of? What was the force of that&#xD;
'And yet' ?"&#xD;
It brought the colour again, and Faith hesitated and&#xD;
looked puzzled. Then she tried a new way of escape.&#xD;
"Don't you mean to let me have any of my thoughts to&#xD;
myself?" she said playfully.&#xD;
"Don't you mean to let me have any of them for&#xD;
myself?"&#xD;
"You ?-Jlaven't you them almost all?"&#xD;
"My dear I beg pardon !-.-.one for every carnation,~but&#xD;
I did not know that I had so nearly made the tour of your&#xD;
mind. I was under the impression that my passports were&#xD;
not yet made out-and that my knowledge of your thoughts.&#xD;
was all gained from certain predatory excursions, telescopic&#xD;
observations, and such like illegal practices. I am sure all&#xD;
my attempts to cross the frontier in the ordinary way are&#xD;
met by something more impassable than a file of bayonets."&#xD;
Faith looked up at him as if to see how much of this was&#xD;
meant for true.&#xD;
"But," said she naively, "I feel as if I had been under&#xD;
a microscope."&#xD;
"My dear !" said Mr. Linden again, with an air at once&#xD;
resigned and deprecating. But then his gravity gave way.&#xD;
"Faith !-is that your feeling in my company? I wonder&#xD;
you can endure the sight of me."&#xD;
"Why ?"-said she timidly.&#xD;
"If I seem to you like a microscope."&#xD;
"Only your eyes, like those power-glasses. .-Not for&#xD;
size !" said Faith, laughing now herself.&#xD;
"Ah little Mignonette," he said smiling, "some things&#xD;
can be seen without microscopic vision. And do not you&#xD;
know, my child, that carnations must draw attention to the&#xD;
particular point round which they bloom ?"&#xD;
"Endy, you shall know what I was thinking of" she&#xD;
said. "You touched it already. It was only-that per-&#xD;
haps sometime you would. be a little proud even of those&#xD;
little things in me-because~Now you can punish me for&#xD;
being proud in earnest !"-It was said in great confusion;&#xD;
it had cost Faith a struggle; the white and red both&#xD;
strove in her downcast face. Mr. Linden might not fathom&#xD;
what was not in a man's nature; but Faith had hardly ever&#xD;
&#xD;
perhapS given him such a token of th9 value she set upon&#xD;
his pleasure.&#xD;
"punish you ?" he said, leaving Jerry to find the road for&#xD;
himself for a minute,-" how shall I do it ?-so? And how&#xD;
much punishment do you require? I think a little is not&#xD;
enough. 'Because' what, love ?"&#xD;
"Endy !-" she said under her breath,.-"you know !-&#xD;
don't ask me."&#xD;
"Then-if I exceed your limits-you will not blame&#xD;
me?"&#xD;
"Limits of what ?"&#xD;
"Limits of this species of executive justice." ~&#xD;
"I don't think you would keep limits of anybody else's&#xD;
setting," said Faith with a little subdued fun. "Look,&#xD;
Endy !-we are coming to Miss Bezac's."&#xD;
"iMlost true," said Mr. Linden, - "now shall you see&#xD;
(perhaps!) one of the innocent sorts of pride that I keep&#xD;
for myself. What have we come for ?" he added laughing, as&#xD;
Jerry trotted up the side hill to the cottage,-" is it butter,&#xD;
or carnations, or dressmaking ?-they all make a rare com-&#xD;

"She is at home !" said Faith,.-"if she wasn't, the win-&#xD;
dow-curtains would be down. Now she is going to be&#xD;
pleased,-and so am I, for she will give me something to&#xD;
eat." Faith looked as if she wanted it, as she softly opened&#xD;
the door of the dressmaker's little parlour, or workroom,&#xD;
and softly went in. The various business and talk of the&#xD;
afternoon had exhausted her.&#xD;
Miss Bezac, having in her young days been not only rich,&#xD;
but also a firstrate needlewoman, now that she was older&#xD;
and poor plied her needle for a different purpose. Yet&#xD;
something of old habits clung to her still; she would not&#xD;
take the common work of the village; but when Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh wanted a gay silk dress, or Miss De Staff a&#xD;
delicate muslin, or Mrs. Somers an embroidered merino-&#xD;
then Miss Bezac was sure to have them go through her&#xD;
hands; and for these ladies she took the fashions and dis-&#xD;
pensed them exceeding well. Strangers too, in Patta-&#xD;
quasset for the summer, often came to her, -~ and had not&#xD;
Miss Bezac made the very first embroidered waistcoat that&#xD;
ever Squire Deacon wore, or Sam Stoutenburgh admired&#xD;

himself in? So her table was generally covered with pretty&#xD;
work, and on this particular afternoon she was choosing the&#xD;
patterns for a second waistcoat for the young member from&#xD;
Quilipeak, a mantilla for his mother, and a silk apron for&#xD;
Miss Essie, all at once. In deep cogitation Faith found hei',&#xD;
and Faith's soft salutation,-&#xD;
"Dear Miss Bezac, will you let st~'angers come in?"&#xD;
How gloriously Faith blushed.&#xD;
"Strangers !" cried Miss Bezac, turning round. "Why&#xD;
Faith !-you don't mean to say it's you ?-though I don't&#xD;
suppose you mean to say it's anybody else. Unless-I do.&#xD;
dare I don't know whether it is you or not !" said Miss&#xD;
J3ezac, looking from her to Mr. Linden and shaking hands&#xD;
with both at once. "Though if it isn't I ought to have&#xD;
heard-only folks don't always do what they ought-at&#xD;
least I don't,-nor much of anything."&#xD;
"It is nobody else yet," said Mr. Linden smiling.&#xD;
Whereat Miss Bezac laid one hand on the other, and&#xD;
stepping back a little surveyed the two 'as a whole.'&#xD;
"Do you know," she said, "(you wouldn't think it) but&#xD;
sometimes I can't say a word !"&#xD;
"You must not expect Faith to say much-she is tired,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden putting her in a chair. "Miss Bezac, I&#xD;
brought her here to get something to eat."&#xD;
"Well I don't believe-I don't really believe that any-&#xD;
body but you would ever do such a kind thing," said iMiss&#xD;
Bezac. "What shall I get? Faith-what will you have?&#xD;
And you're well enough to be out again !-and it's so woll&#xD;
I'm not out myself !-I'll run and see if the flu ~. ain't,~-.&#xD;
the kettle ought to be boiled, for I wanted an ea.. ly cup of&#xD;
tea."&#xD;
"No, dear Miss Bezac, don't !" said Faith. "Only give&#xD;
me some bread and milk."&#xD;
Miss l3ezac stopped short.&#xD;
"Bread and milk ?" she said-.-" is tliat good for you?&#xD;
The bread's goody I know, baked last night; and the milk&#xD;
always is sweet, up here with the cowslips -and most&#xD;
things are sweet when you're hungry. But ain't you more&#xD;
hungry than that ?-and somebody else might be, if you&#xD;
ain't-and one always must think of somebody else too.&#xD;
But you do, I'll say that for you. And oh didn't I say long&#xD;

ago !-" A. fanny little collective pause Miss Bezac&#xD;
made, her thoughts going back even to the night of the&#xD;
celebration. Then she ran away for the bread and milk,...-.&#xD;
then she came back and put her head in at the door.&#xD;
"Faith, do you like a cup or a bowl ?-.-I like a cup7&#xD;
because 1 always think of a cup of comfort-and I never&#xD;
he~~4 of a bowl of anything. But you can have which you&#xD;
like."&#xD;
"I like the cup too," said Faith laughing. "But even&#xD;
the bowl would be comfort to-day, Miss Bezac."&#xD;
The cup came, and a little pitcher for replenishing, and a&#xD;
blue plate of very white bread and very brown bread, and&#xD;
one of Miss Bezac's old-fashioned silver spoons, and a little&#xD;
loaf of 'one, two, three, four, cake', that looked as good as&#xD;
the bread., All of which were arranged on a round stand&#xD;
before Faith by Miss Bezac and Mr. Linden jointly. He&#xD;
brought her a footstool too, and with persuasive fingers&#xD;
untied and took off her bonnet-which supplementary ar-&#xD;
rangements Miss Bezac surveyed with folded hands and&#xD;
great admiration. Which also made the pale cheeks flush&#xD;
again, bat that was pretty to look upon. Faith betook&#xD;
herself to the old-fashioned spoon and the milk, then gave&#xD;
Mr. Linden something to do in the shape of a piece of cake;&#xD;
and then resigning herself to circumstances broke brown&#xD;
bread into the milk and eat it with great and profitable&#xD;
satisfaction, leaving the conversation in the hands of the&#xD;
other two. The sun sank lower and lower, sending fare-&#xD;
well bearrw~,into the valleys, and shaking out gold pieces in&#xD;
Miss Be~q~?s little brown sitting-room like the WIII-o'-&#xD;
wisps in the 'Tale of tales'. Through the open door her&#xD;
red cow might be seen returning home by a winding and&#xD;
circuitous path, such as cows love, and a little sparrow&#xD;
hopped in and out, from the doorstep, looking for 'One,&#xD;
two, three, four', crumbs. Faith from her seat near the&#xD;
are could see it all....-if her eyes chose to pass Mr. Linden ,~&#xD;
what he saw, she found out whenever they went that way.&#xD;
It was not~wonderful that Faith turned from the table at&#xD;
last with a very refreshed face.&#xD;
"Miss Bezac, you have made me up," she said smiling.&#xD;
"Have I?" said her little hostess,-"well that comes&#xD;
pretty near it. Do you know when I saw you I mean&#xD;

&#xD;
when I saw both of you, I really thought you had come fo~&#xD;
me to make up something else? And I must say, I wish&#xD;
you had,-not that I haven't dresses enough, and too&#xD;
many-unless I had a new pair of eyes-but I always did&#xD;
set my heart on making that one. And I haven't set my&#xD;
heart upon many things for' a good while, so of course j&#xD;
ain't used to being disappointed. You won't begin, will&#xD;
you, Faith?"&#xD;
Faith kissed her, hastily expressing the unsentimental&#xD;
hope that her tea would be as good as her bread ~and milk;&#xD;
and ran out, leaving Mr. Linden to follow at his leisure.&#xD;
Faith was found untying Jerry.&#xD;
"What do you mean ?" said Mr. Linden staying her&#xD;
hands and lifting her in the most sumfriary manner into the&#xD;
wagon. "Bread and milk is too stimulating for you, child,&#xD;
.-we must find something less exciting. What will you&#xD;
see fit to do next?"&#xD;
"I can untie a bridle," said Faith.&#xD;
"Or slip your head through one. But you should have&#xD;
Seen the delight with which Miss Bezac entered upon the&#xD;
year of patience that I prescribed to her !-and the very&#xD;
(innocuous)&#xD;
pride that lay hid in the prescription. Do you&#xD;
feel disposed to punish me for that, Mignonette ?"&#xD;
One of Faith's grave childish looks answered him; but&#xD;
then, dismissing Mr. Linden as impracticable, she gave&#xD;
herself to the enjoyment of the time. It was a fit after.&#xD;
noon! The sunbeams were bright on leaves and flowers,&#xD;
with that fairy brightness which belongs peculiarly to&#xD;
spring. The air was a real spring air, sweet and bracing,&#xD;
full of delicate spices of May. The apple blossoms, out&#xD;
and bursting out, dressed the land with the very bloom of&#xD;
joy. And through it all Mr. Linden drove her, himself in&#xD;
a "holiday humour." Bread and milk may be stimulating,&#xD;
but health and happiness are more stimulating yet; and&#xD;
Faith caine home after a ride of some length looking not a&#xD;
bit the worse, and ready for supper.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
A MONTH passed awa.y,.-with apple blossoms, straw--&#xD;
11 berry flowers, now with strawberries themselves. Roses&#xD;
corning into splendour, carnations in full force, and both re-&#xD;
established in the cheeks of Faith Derrick. What a month&#xD;
it had been !-of weather, of work, of society. Lessons&#xD;
~ter the old fashion, reading aloud, talking ~ going round&#xD;
the country at Jerry's heels, or on the back of Mrs. Stout-&#xD;
enburgh's pony~foP there she was put, just so soon as she&#xD;
could bear it, passing by degrees from a gentle trot on&#xD;
level ground to a ladylike scamper over the hills. Faith&#xD;
had not been so strong for many a day as the longest day&#xD;
of that summer found her.&#xD;
Coming home from their afternoon ride by the way of the&#xD;
postoffice, Mr. Linden found there a letter from Europe;&#xD;
the seal of which lie broke as they entered the house, just&#xD;
in time to give Faith a little enclosed note to herself as she&#xD;
went up stairs to change her dress. Its words were few.&#xD;
Referrino' Faith to Mr. Linden for particulars, it asked her&#xD;
to let him come to Germany without delay. The aunt with&#xD;
whom Miss Linden lived was at the point of death, appar-&#xD;
utly-she herself in danger of being left quite alone in a&#xD;
range land. Yet with all~the urgency of the case, the&#xD;
whole breathing of Miss Linden's note was, "Faith-can&#xD;
you spare him ?-will you let him come ?"&#xD;
The question was settled before it was asked, in Faith's&#xD;
mind; but what a laying down of pleasure and what a&#xD;
taking up of pain was there! The rest of the vacation&#xD;
was gone at once; for Mr. Linden could not go to Eu rope&#xD;
and come back, even on the wings of steam, and have a&#xD;
day left1 before study would begin again. No more of him&#xD;
-except, at the best, snatches-till next year; and next&#xD;
year was very far oft; and who could tell what might be&#xD;
next year? But at the best, she must see little more of&#xD;
him until then; and in the mean time he must put half the&#xD;
world between them. Nobody saw how fast the roses&#xD;

faded on Faith's cheek; she sat and looked at the matter&#xD;
all alone, and looked it through. For one few minutes;~&#xD;
and then she rose up and began dressing slowly, looking at&#xD;
it still, but gathering all her forces together to deal with it,&#xD;
And when her dressing was done, she still stood leaning&#xD;
one hand and her head on the dressing table, thinking Over&#xD;
all that was to do. She had remembered, as with a flash&#xD;
of remembrance, what day the next steamed' would saiL...&#xD;
from what port-she knew the hour when Mr. Linden must&#xD;
leave Pattaquasset. And when her mind had seen all the&#xD;
preparations to be made, and she thought she was strong&#xD;
enough, she turned to go down stairs; but then feeling very&#xD;
weak Faith turned again and kneeled down to pray. And&#xD;
in a mixed feeling of strength and weakness, she went&#xD;
down stairs.&#xD;
First to the kitchen, where she quietly looked after the&#xD;
state of the clothes in the wash, and desired Cindy to have&#xD;
all Mr. Linden's things ready for ironing that evening.&#xD;
Then attended to the supply of bread and the provision for&#xD;
breakfast; saw that one or two things about the supper&#xD;
were in proper order and progress; asked Mrs. Derrick to&#xD;
make the tea when it was time, and finally, as quietly as if&#xD;
the afternoon's ride had been the only event of the after-&#xD;
noon, opened the door of the sitting - room and softly&#xD;
went in,&#xD;
For a while after reading his own letter Mr. Linden had&#xD;
sat abso tely still,.-then with a sort of impatience to see&#xD;
Faith, to give her what comfort he could, at least to have&#xD;
her with him every minute, he had paced up and down the&#xD;
sitting-room till she appeared. Now he took her in his&#xD;
arms with all sorts of tender caresses-.with no words at&#xD;
first but, "My little Mignonette !" Faith herself was quite&#xD;
still and wordless; only once, and that suddenly and ear..&#xD;
neatly, she gave his cheek the salutation she had never&#xD;
given him before unbidden. From her it was a whole&#xD;
volume, and thoroughly peace-speaking, although it might&#xD;
intimate a little difficulty of words.&#xD;
Keeping one arm round her, Mr. Linden began again&#xD;
his walk up and down the room; beginning to talk as well&#xD;
-.---teliing her what was in his letter, how long the journey&#xD;
would take, and more than all, what she must do while ho&#xD;
&#xD;
was away. flow long the absence would be-when he&#xD;
should be at home again, that was little touched upon by&#xD;
either; the return might be very speedy-that seemed most&#xD;
probable~ but neither he nor Faith cared to put in words&#xD;
all the uncertainties that hung about it. From every point&#xD;
he came back to her,.-with injunctions about her strength,&#xD;
and directions about her studies, and charges to take care&#xD;
of herself for him-with other words of comfort and&#xD;
cheering, spoken cheerfully from a very sorrowful heart.&#xD;
One other charge he gave-..&#xD;
"My little Sunbeam, my dearest Faith, keep both your&#xD;
names unclouded !"&#xD;
"I have had one lesson, Endy-"&#xD;
She was a little pale, but had listened to him quietly as&#xD;
intently; voice and smile both ready to do their part, albeit&#xD;
gravely, whenever there was a l)art for them.&#xD;
"I shall not forget-" she added now with a smile, a rare&#xD;
one, after a little pause.&#xD;
ile brought her back to the sofa then, kissing the pale&#xD;
cheeks as if he missed their carnations. Yet-with the&#xD;
stringency of the old law which saith that "Doublet and&#xD;
hose must shew itself courageous to petticoat ".-Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den gave her bright words, although they were words of a&#xD;
very grave brightness-not contradicted, but qualified by&#xD;
his eyes.&#xD;
"Mign onette," he said, "I did not think next year could&#xD;
gain brightness from anything-but I cannot tell you how&#xD;
it has looked to me within these last two hours. If I could&#xD;
but call in Mr. Somers, and then take you with me 1"&#xD;
It brought a rush of the carnations; but Faith did not&#xD;
think so extravagant a wish required any combating. Nei-&#xD;
ther did she say what she thought of "next year."&#xD;
That evening at least they had quietly together. What&#xD;
Faith did after they had separated for the night, Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den never knew; but the morning saw everything ready&#xD;
for his departure,-ready down to the little details which a&#xD;
man recognizes only (for the most part) by the sense of&#xD;
want. And if cheeks were paler than last night, they were&#xD;
only now and then less steady-till he was gone.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
J~R. HARRISON took passage in the steamship VuI.&#xD;
can, C. W. Cyclops, commander, for the Old W~rId;&#xD;
having come to the conclusion that the southern coiAnti'y&#xD;
was not sufficiently remote, and that only a change of hemi.&#xD;
spheres would suit the precise state of his mind. Letters&#xD;
of combined farewell and notice-giving, reached Pattaquas.&#xD;
set too late to number the doctor with a bevy of friends to&#xD;
see him off; but his sudden motions were too well known,&#xD;
and his peculiarities too long established, to excite much&#xD;
surprise or dismay by any new manifestations.&#xD;
The Vulcan lay getting her steam up in that fair June&#xD;
morning, with very little regard to the amount of high pres.&#xD;
sure that her passengers might bring on board. Nothing&#xD;
could be more regardless of their hurry and bustle, the&#xD;
causes that brought them, the tears they shed, the friends&#xD;
they left behind, than the ship with her black sides and red&#xD;
smoke pipe. Tears did indeed trickle down some parts of&#xD;
her machinery, but they were only condensed steam~-..which&#xD;
might indeed be true of some of the tears of her pas..&#xD;
singers.&#xD;
Punctual to her time she left her moorings, steaming&#xD;
down the beautiful bay with all the June light upon her,&#xD;
throwing back little foamy waves that glittered in the sun,&#xD;
making her farewell with a long train of blue rollers that&#xD;
came one after another to kiss the shore. What if tears&#xD;
sprinkled the dusty sidewalks of Canal St. ?-.what if that&#xD;
same light shone on white handkerchiefs and bowed heads?&#xD;
-The answering drops might fall in the state-rooms of&#xD;
the Vulcan, but on deck bustle and excitement had their&#xD;
way.&#xD;
So went on the miles and the hou~s,~then the pilot left&#xD;
the vessel, taking with him a little handful of letters~ and&#xD;
the passengers who had been down stairs to write were on&#xD;
deck, watching him off. In the city business rolled on with&#xD;
its closing tide,-.--far down on the Long Branch shore peo-&#xD;
(3~O)&#xD;
&#xD;
u&#xD;
&#xD;
pie looked northward towards a dim outline, a little waft&#xD;
of smoke, and said-~" There goes the Vulcan." The fresh-&#xD;
ening breeze, the long rolls of the Atlantic, sent some pas..&#xD;
sengers below, even now,.-.others stood gazing back at the&#xD;
faint city indications,-others still walked up and down-.-.&#xD;
those who had left little, or cared little for what they had&#xD;
left. Of these was Dr. Harrison, who paced the deck with&#xD;
very easy external manifestations.&#xD;
Some change of mind-some freak of fancy, sent him&#xD;
at last to the other side of the ship-then to the prow.&#xD;
Here sailors were busy,-here one passenger stood alone:&#xD;
but if there had been twenty more, Dr. Harrison could&#xD;
have seen but this one. He was standing with arms folded,&#xD;
in a sort of immoveable position, that yet accommodated&#xD;
itself easily to the ship's slow courtseying; as regardless&#xD;
of that as of the soft play of the sea breeze; looking back&#xD;
.-but not to the place where the Vulcan had lain a few&#xD;
hours before. He was rather looking forward ,-looking&#xD;
off to some spot that lay north or northeast of them: some&#xD;
spot invisible, yet how clearly seen! Looking thither,-as&#xD;
if in all the horizon that alone had any interest. So ab-&#xD;
sorbed-so far from the ship,-his lips set in such grave,&#xD;
sad lines; his eyes so intent, as if they could by no means&#xD;
look at anything else. Nay, for the time, there was noth-&#xD;
ing else to see! Dr. Harrison might come or go-the&#xD;
sailors might do their utmost,-.--far over the rolling water,&#xD;
conscious of that only because&amp;amp; it was a barrier of separa-&#xD;
tion, the watcher's eyes rested on Mignonette. If once&#xD;
or twice the eyelids fell, it was not that the vision failed.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison stopped short, unseen, and not wishing at&#xD;
that moment to meet the consequences of being seen. Yet&#xD;
he stood still and looked. The first feeling being one of&#xD;
intense displeasure and disgust that the Vulcan carried so&#xD;
unwelcome a fellow-passenger; the second, of unbounded&#xD;
astonishment and wonder what he did there. He putting&#xD;
the ocean between him and Pattaquasset? he setting out&#xD;
for the Old World, with all his hopes just blossoming in&#xD;
the New? What could be the explanation? Was it possi..&#xD;
ble, Dr. Harrison asked himself for one moment, that he&#xD;
could have been mistaken? that he could have misunder-&#xD;
stood the issue of the conversation that morning in Faith's&#xD;

sick room? A moment resolved him. lie recalled the&#xD;
steady, dauntless look of Faith's eyes after his words,....~&#xD;
look which he had two or three times been privileged to&#xD;
receive from her and never cared to meet '-.--.he remembered&#xD;
how daintily her colour rose as her eyes fell, and the slow&#xD;
deliberate uncovering of her diamond finge~ from which&#xD;
the eyes were not raised again to look at him ; he remelii.&#xD;
bered it with the embittered pang of the moment. No l&#xD;
he had not been mistaken; he had read hei~ right. Could&#xD;
it be.-it crossed the doctor's mind like a flash of the intense.&#xD;
est hghtning-.that his letter had done its work? its work&#xD;
of separation? But the cool reminder of reason came like&#xD;
the darkness after the lightning. Mr. Linden would riot&#xD;
have been at Mrs. Derrick's, a~ the doctor had heard of his&#xD;
being there, if any entering wedge of division had made&#xD;
itself felt between his place there and him. No, though&#xD;
now he was here in the Vulcan. And Dr. Harrison no.&#xD;
ticed anew, keenly, that the expression of the gazer's face,&#xD;
though sorrowful and grave, was in nowise dark or de.&#xD;
spending. Nothing of that! The grave brow was unbent&#xD;
in every line of it; the grave lips had no hard set of pain;&#xD;
the doctor read them well, both lips and brow! Mr. .L1in.&#xD;
den was no man to stand and look towards Pattaquasset if&#xD;
he had nothing there. And with a twinge he now recol-&#xD;
lected the unwanted sound of that name from the pilot's&#xD;
mouth as he took charge of the letters and went off. Ay!&#xD;
and turning with the thought the doctor paced back again,&#xD;
as, unregardful now of the contents of the Vulcan, animate&#xD;
or Inanimate, as the man himself whom he had been watch.&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
What should he do? he must meet him and speak to&#xD;
him, though the doctor desired nothing less in the whole&#xD;
broad earth. But he must do it, for the maintenance of&#xD;
his own character and the safety of his own secret and&#xD;
pride that hung thereby. That little piece of simplicity&#xD;
up there in the country had managed to say him no with..&#xD;
out being directly asked to say anything......-thanks to her&#xD;
truthful hoi esty; and perhaps, a twinge or two of another&#xD;
sort came to Dr. liziarrison's mind as he thought of his rela-&#xD;
tions with her,-..yes, and of his relations with him. Not&#xD;
pleasant, but all the more, if possible, Dr. Harrison set hi~&#xD;
&#xD;
teeth and resolved to speak to Mr. Linden the first oppor-&#xD;
tunity. All the more, that he was not certain Mr. Linden&#xD;
bad received his letter,.-4t was likely, yet Dr. Harrison had&#xD;
had no note of the fact. It might have failed. And not-&#xD;
~~thstanding all the conclusions to which his meditations&#xD;
had come, curiosity lingered yet ;-a morbid curiosity, un-&#xD;
reasonable, as he said to himself, yet uncontrollable, to see&#xD;
by eye and ear witness, even in actual speech and conver-&#xD;
sation, whether all was well with Mr. Linden or not. his&#xD;
own power of self-possession Dr. Harrison could trust; he&#xD;
would try that of the other. Yet he took tolerably good&#xD;
care that the opportunity of speaking should not be this&#xD;
evening. The doctor did not come in to supper till all the&#xD;
passengers were seated, or nearly so, and then carried him-&#xD;
self to the end of the apartment furthest from his friend;&#xD;
where he so bore his part that no mortal could have sup-&#xD;
posed Dr. Harrison had suffered lately in mind, body, or&#xD;
estate.&#xD;
Mr. Linden's part that night was a quiet one, the volun-&#xD;
tally part of it, and strictly confined to the various little&#xD;
tea-table courtesies which with him might indeed be called&#xD;
involuntary. But it so happened that the Vulcan carried~&#xD;
out quite a knot of his former friends-gentlemen who&#xD;
knew him well, and these from their various places at the&#xD;
table spoke either to him or of him frequently. Dr. Har-&#xD;
rison in the pauses of his own talk could hear, "Linden"&#xD;
-" Endecott Linden "-" John, what have you been doing&#xD;
with yourself ?"-in different tones of question or comment,&#xD;
-sometimes caught the tones of Mr. Linden's voice in&#xD;
reply; but as they were both on the same side of the table&#xD;
eyesight was not called for. The doctor sat in his place&#xD;
until the table was nearly cleared; then sauntered forth&#xD;
into the evening light. Fair, bright, glowing light, up~on&#xD;
gay water and a gay deck-fall; but Di'. Harrison gaining&#xD;
nothing from its brightness, stood looking out on its reflec-&#xD;
tion in the waves more gloomily than he had seen another&#xD;
look a little time ago. Then a hand was laid lightly on&#xD;
his shoulder, making its claim of acquaintanceship with a&#xD;
very kind, friendly touch. The doctor turned and met&#xD;
hand and eye with as far as could be seen his old manner,&#xD;
only perhaps his fingers released themselves a little sooner&#xD;

than once they would, and the smile was a trifle more broad&#xD;
than it might if there had been no constraint about it.&#xD;
"I am not altogether taken now by surprise," said he,&#xD;

Linden                 ~o. What are you dcing here,&#xD;
"Rocking in the cradle of business as well as of the&#xD;
deep," said Mr. Linden. "The last steamer brought word&#xD;
that I must sail by this, and so here I am."&#xD;
"Who rocks the cradle of business ?" said the doctor&#xD;
with the old comical lift of the eyebrows with which he&#xD;
used to begin a tilt with Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Duty and Interest rock it between them,-.-singing of&#xD;
rest, and keeping one awake thereby."&#xD;
"A proper pair of nurses !" said the doctor. "Why&#xD;
man, they would tear the infant Business to pieces between&#xD;
them! Unless one of them did as much for the other in&#xD;
time to prevent it."&#xD;
"Never-unless Inclination took the place of JnteresL"&#xD;
"Don't make any difference," said the doctor;-."Jncli-&#xD;
nation always follows the lead of Interest..-....-Except in a&#xD;
few extraordinary specimens of human nature."&#xD;
Mr. Linden turned towards the scattered groups of pas-&#xD;
sengers, and so doing his eye caught the shining of that&#xD;
very star which was rising over Pattaquasset as he and&#xD;
Mignonette rode home two nights before. Only two nights!&#xD;
-For a minute everything else might have been at the an-&#xD;
tipodes-then Mr. Linden brought at least his eyes baclC&#xD;
to the deck of tIi~ V ulean. "What sort of a motley have&#xD;
we here, doctor? Do you know many of them ?"&#xD;
"Yes-....-" said the doctor slightly ;-.--" the usual combina-&#xD;
tions of Interest and Inclination. I wonder if we are&#xD;
exceptions, Linden ?"&#xD;
"The usual combination is not, perhaps, just the bests-&#xD;
it is a nice matter for a man to judge in his own case how&#xD;
far the proportions are rectified."&#xD;
"lie can't do it. Ililuman machinery can't do it. Can&#xD;
you measure the height of those waves while they dazzle&#xD;
your eyes with gold and purple as they do now&#xD;
"Nay-but I can tell how much they do or do not throw&#xD;
me out of my right course."&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"What course are you on flow, Linden ?" said the doc~&#xD;
tor with his old-fashioned assumption of carelessness, dis-&#xD;
missing the subject.&#xD;
"Now?" Mr. Linden repeated. "Do you mean in studies,&#xD;
travels, or conversation ?"&#xD;
"' In conversation, you have as usual brought me to a&#xD;
point! I mean-if I mean 'anything,-the other two; but&#xD;
I mean nothing, unless you like."&#xD;
"I do like. Just now, then, I am in the vacation before&#xD;
the last year of my Seminary life,.-for the rest, I am on&#xD;
my way to Germany."&#xD;
"Finish your course there, eh ?" said the doctor. "Why&#xD;
man, I thought you had found the 'four azure chains' long&#xD;
ago."&#xD;
"No, not to finish my course,-if I am kept in Germany&#xD;
more than a few weeks, it will not be by 'azure' chains,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"That it will not !" said one of the young men coming&#xD;
up, fresh from the tea-table and his cigar. "Azure chains?&#xD;
-pooh !-Linden breaks them as easy as Samson did the&#xD;
green withs. How biblical it makes one to be in company&#xD;
with such a theologian! But I shouldn't wonder if he was&#xD;
going to Europe to join some order of friars-he'll find&#xD;
nothing monastic enough for him in America."&#xD;
"Mistaken your man, Motley !" said the doctor; who for&#xD;
reasons of his own did not choose to quit the conversation.&#xD;
"The worst I have to say of him is, that if he spends an-&#xD;
other year in germany his hearers will never be able to&#xD;
understand him I"&#xD;
"Mistaken him !" said Mr. Motley-" at this time of&#xD;
day,-that'll do! Where did you get acquainted with him,&#xD;
pray ?"&#xD;
"Once when I had the management of him," said the&#xD;
doctor coolly. "There is no way of becoming acquainted&#xD;
with a man, like that."&#xD;
"Once when you thought you had," said Mr. Motley.&#xD;
"Well, where was it ?-~-in a dark passage when you got to&#xD;
the door first?"&#xD;
".Whenever I have had the misfortune to be in a dark&#xD;
passage with him, he has showed me the door,"-said the&#xD;

.doctor gravely but gracefully, in his old fashion admirab1~&#xD;
maintained.&#xD;
"If one of you wasn't Endecott Linden," said Mr. Mot.&#xD;
ley throwing the end of his cigar overboard, "I shou}~&#xD;
think you had made acquaintance on a highway robbery."&#xD;
"Instead of which, it was in the peaceful town of Pat.&#xD;
taquasset," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Permit me to request the reason of Mr. Motle~'8&#xD;
extraordinary guess," said the doctor.&#xD;
"So natural to say where you've met a man-if there's&#xD;
no reason against it," said the other coolly. "But you&#xD;
don't say it was in Pattaquasset, doctor? Were you ever&#xD;
there ?"&#xD;
"Depends entirely on the decision of certain questions iu&#xD;
metaphysics,"said the doctor. "As for instance, whether&#xD;
anything that is, is-and the matter of. personal identity,&#xD;
which you know is doubtful. I know the appearance of&#xD;
the place7 Motley."&#xD;
"Are there any pretty girls there ?" said Mr. Motley,&#xD;
carelessly, but keeping his eye rather on Mr. Linden thau&#xD;
the doctor.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden can answer better than 17," said Dr. Harri-&#xD;
son, whose eye also turned that way, and whose tone&#xD;
changed somewhat in spite of himself. "There are none&#xD;
there that could not answer any question about Mr.&#xD;
Linden. "-.&#xD;
"By the help of a powerful imagination," said the per.&#xD;
son spoken of. Mr. Motley looked from one to the other.&#xD;
"I don't know what to make of either of you," he said.&#xD;
"Why doctor, Endecott Linden is a-a mere-I don't like&#xD;
to call him hard names, and I can't call him soft ones!&#xD;
However-to be sure-the cat may look at the king, even&#xD;
if his majesty won't return the compliment. Well.-.you and&#xD;
I were never thought hard-hearted, so I'll tell you my story.&#xD;
Did it ever happen-or seem to happen, doctor-that&#xD;
you, seeming to be in Pattaquasset, went-not to church-&#xD;
but along the road therefrom? Preferring the exit to the&#xD;
entrance-as you and I too often do ?"&#xD;
"It has seemed to happen to me,"-said Dr. Harrison,&#xD;
as if mechanically.&#xD;
"Well-George Alcott and I-do you know George ?-no&#xD;
&#xD;
great loss-We were kept one Sun a in that respectable,&#xD;
little town by a freshet. Whether iNas one of those&#xD;
rains that bring down more things from tli~sky than water,&#xD;
I don't know,-George declared ft was. If it wasn't, we&#xD;
made discoveries."&#xD;
"If you and George both used your eyes, there must&#xD;
have been discoveries," said Mr. Linden. "Did you take&#xD;
notice how green the grass looked after the rain? and that&#xD;
when the clouds were blown away the sun shone ?"&#xD;
"You're not all theology yet I" said Mr. Motley. "Be&#xD;
quiet-can't you? I'm not talking to you. We were&#xD;
sauntering down this same road, doctor-after church,-&#xD;
falling in with the people, so that we could see them and&#xD;
be taken for churchgoers. But there wasn't much to see.-&#xD;
Then 4I~eorge declared that here was the place where Lin-&#xD;
den had secluded himself for nobody knows what,-then&#xD;
we fell naturally into lamenting the waste of such fine ma-&#xD;
terial, and conned over various particulars of his former&#xD;
life and prospects - the great promise of past years, the&#xD;
present melancholy mania to make money and be use-&#xD;
ful. Upon which points George and I fought as usual.&#xD;
Then we grew tired of the subject and of the mud-t--.ttirned&#xD;
short about-and beheld-what do you suppose, doctor ?"&#xD;
"how far you had come for nothing ?"&#xD;
"Imagine," said Mr. Motley, taking out a fresh cigar and&#xD;
a match and proceeding to put them to their respective&#xD;
uses,-" Imagine the vision that appeared to Balaarn's ass&#xD;
..-and how the ass felL"&#xD;
"Nay, that we cannot do," said Mr. Linden. "You tax&#xD;
us too far."&#xD;
"In both requisitions-" added the doctor.&#xD;
"There stood," said Mr. Motley, removing his cigar and&#xD;
waving it gracefully in one hand. "There stood close&#xD;
behind us on the mud-she could not have been in it-an&#xD;
immortal creature, in mortal merino! We -transfixed,&#xD;
mute-stepped aside right and left to let her pass,-I be-&#xD;
lieve George had presence of mind enough to take off his&#xD;
hat; and she-' severe in youthful beauty', glorious in youth-&#xD;
ful blushes-walked on, looking full at us as she went. But&#xD;

worth looking at 1"&#xD;
"Jt has had more help from you," Mr. Linden said, con.&#xD;
trolling the involuntary unbent play of eye and lip with&#xD;
which he had heard the description.&#xD;
"Well, George raved about them for a month," Mr.&#xD;
Motley went on, "and staid in Pattaquasset a whole week&#xD;
to see them again-which he didn't; so he made up his&#xD;
mind that they had escaped in the train of events-or of&#xD;
cars, and now seeks them through the world. Some (lay&#xD;
he will meet them in the possession of Mrs. Somebody-.&#xD;
and then hang himself." And Mr. Motley puffed out&#xD;
clouds of smoke thereupon.&#xD;
"According to your account, he could not do better,"&#xD;
said the doctor cynically.&#xD;
"1 suppose the world would get on, if he did," said Mr.&#xD;
Motley with philosophical coolness. "But the qucerity&#xD;
was," he added, removing the cigar once more, "what made&#xD;
her look at us so? Did she know by her supernatural&#xD;
vision that we had not been to church ?-for I must say,&#xD;
Linden, she looked like one of your kind. Or were her&#xD;
unearthly ears charmed by the account of your unearthly&#xD;
perfection ?.-for George and I were doing the thing hand-&#xD;
somely."&#xD;
~' It was probably that," said Mr. Linden. "Few people,&#xD;
I think, can listen to your stories unmoved."&#xD;
"Hang it," said Mr. Motley, "I wish I could !-.This&#xD;
vixenish old craft is behaving with a great deal too much&#xD;
suavity to suit my notions. I don't care about making a&#xD;
reverence to every wave I meet if they're going to tower&#xD;
up at this rate. But I guess you're right, Linden -the&#xD;
description of you can be made quite captivating-and her&#xD;
cheeks glowed like damask roses with some sort of inspira-&#xD;
tion. However, as George pathetically and poetically&#xD;
remarks,&#xD;
'I only know she caine and went !'-.&#xD;
the last part of which illustrious example I shall follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
Linden, if any story don't move you, you're no better than&#xD;
the North Cape."&#xD;
"Can you stand it ?"-asked the doctor suddenly of his&#xD;
remaining companion.&#xD;
"Yes-I have known Motley a long time."&#xD;
"Pshaw! no, I mean this wind."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon! Yes-for anything I have felt&#xD;
of it yet."&#xD;
"If you will excuse me, I will get something more on.&#xD;
J have come from a warmer part of the world lately."&#xD;
rme doctor disappeared, and found something in another&#xD;
part of the boat to detain him.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison had stood one conversation, but he had no&#xD;
mind to stand a second. He did not think it necessary.&#xD;
If by any possibility he could have put himself on board&#xD;
of another steamer, or packet; or have leaped forward into&#xD;
France, or back into America 1-he would have done it.&#xD;
But since he must see Mr. Linden from time to time in&#xD;
their present situation, he contrived that that should be&#xD;
all. Even that was as seldom and as little as possible; the&#xD;
art not to see, Dr. Harrison could practise to perfection, and&#xD;
did now; so far as he could without rendering it too obvi.-&#xD;
ously a matter of his own will. That would not have&#xD;
suited his plans. So he saw his one-time friend as often as&#xD;
he must, and then was civil invariably, civil with the respect&#xD;
which was Dr. Harrison's highest degree of civility and&#xD;
which probably in this instance was true and heartfelt; but&#xD;
he was cool, after his slight gay surface manner, and even&#xD;
when speaking kept at a distance. For the rest, it is&#xD;
notable, even in so small a space as the walls of a steamer&#xD;
shut in, how far apart people can be that have no wish to&#xD;
be near. Days passed that saw at the utmost only a bow&#xD;
exchanged between. these two; many days that heard but&#xD;
one or two words. Mr. Linden's own plans and occupa-&#xD;
tions, the arrangement of his time, helped to further the&#xD;
doctor's wish. There was many an hour when Dr. Harrison&#xD;
would not have found him if he had tried, but when they&#xD;
were really together the non-intercourse was the doctor's&#xD;
fault. For all that had been, Mr. Linden was still his&#xD;
friend,-he realized more and more every day the value of&#xD;

&#xD;
the prize for which Dr. Harrison had played and lost; and&#xD;
pity had made forgiveness easy. He was ready for all&#xD;
their old kindly intercourse, but seeing the doctor 5hU~~~d&#xD;
him there was nothing to do but follow the lead. Some.&#xD;
times indeed they came together for a few miflUtcs-.---wcre&#xD;
thrown so-in a way that was worse than hours of talk.&#xD;
The Vulcan had made about half her passage, and a&#xD;
fair, fresh morning had brought most of the passengers o~&#xD;
deck. Mr. Linden was not there, but the rest were grouped&#xD;
and watching the approach of a homeward hound steamer;&#xD;
" when as she neared them Mr. Linden too came on deck,&#xD;
lit was to talk with the Captain however, not the passed.&#xD;
gers-or to consult with him, for the two stood together&#xD;
speaking and smiling. "You can try," Dr. Harrison heard&#xD;
the Captain say; and then he lifted his trumpet and hailed&#xD;
.-the other Captain responding. Still the steamer came&#xD;
on, nearer and nearer,- still the two on the deck of the&#xD;
Vulcan stood side by side; till at a certain point, just where&#xD;
the vessels were at the nearest, Captain Cyclops gave his&#xD;
companion a little signal nod. And Mr. Linden stepping&#xD;
forward a pace or two, lent the whole power of his skill and&#xD;
strength to send a dispatch on board the Polar Bear. The&#xD;
little packet sped from his hand, spinning through the air&#xD;
like a dark speck. Not a person spoke or moved-Would&#xD;
it reach ?-.would it fail ? - until the packet, just clearing&#xD;
the guards, fell safe on the deck of the other vessel, was&#xD;
picked up by her Captain and proclaimed through the&#xD;
speaking trumpet. Slightly raising his, hat then, Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den drew hack from his forward position; just as a shout&#xD;
of delighted acclaim burst from bQth the boats.&#xD;
"That went with a will, I tell youi" said Captain Cy..&#xD;
clops with a little nod of his head.&#xD;
"1 say, Linden !" spoke out one of the young men-" is&#xD;
that your heart you sei~it home ?"&#xD;
"I feel it beating here yet," Mr. Linden answered. But&#xD;
just how much of it he carried back to his state-room for the&#xD;
next hour has never been ascertained. Society had no help&#xD;
from Dr. Harrison for more than that length of time.&#xD;
Neither could proximity nor anything else make him,&#xD;
visibly, aware of Mr. Linden's existence during the rest of&#xD;
the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Linden knew the doctor too well - and it may be&#xD;
said, knew Faith too well-to be much surprised at that.&#xD;
If he could have spared Dr. Harrison the pain of seeing&#xD;
his little air-sent missive, he would have done it; but the&#xD;
letter could go but at one time, and from one side of the&#xD;
ship-and just there and then Dr. Harrison chose to be.&#xD;
But though the sort of growing estrangement which the&#xD;
doctor practiced sprang from no wish nor feeling but his&#xD;
own, yet Mr. Linden found it hard to touch it in any way.&#xD;
Sometimes he tried-sometimes he left it for Time's touch-&#xD;
ing, which mends so many things. And slowly, and gently,&#xD;
that touch did work - not by fading one feeling but by&#xD;
deepening another. Little as Dr. Harrison had to do with&#xD;
his friend, almost every one else in the ship had a good deal,&#xD;
and the place which Mr. Linden soon took in the admiration&#xD;
as well as the respect of the passengers, could not fail to&#xD;
come to the doctor's notice. Men of very careless life and&#xD;
opinions pruned their language in his presence,-those who&#xD;
lived but for themselves, and took poor care of what they&#xD;
lived for, passed him reverently on some of his errands&#xD;
through the ship. Dr. Harrison had never lived with him&#xD;
before, and little as they saw each other, you could as well&#xD;
conceal the perfume of a hidden bunch of violets - as well&#xD;
shut your senses to the spring air-as could the doctor shut&#xD;
his to the beauty of that well-grown Christian character.&#xD;
The light of it shone, and the influence of it went forth&#xD;
through all the ship.&#xD;
"What a strange, incomprehensible, admirable fellow,&#xD;
Linden is !" said Mr. Motley one day when he and the doc-&#xD;
tor were sunning themselves in profound laziness on deck.&#xD;
It was rather late Sunday afternoon, and the morning ser-&#xD;
vice had left a sort of respectful quietness behind it.&#xD;
"He must be !" said the doctor with a slight indescrib-&#xD;
able expression,-"if at this moment you can be roused to&#xD;
wonder at anything. ~&#xD;
Mr. Motley inclined his head with perfect suavity in&#xD;
honour of the doctor's words.&#xD;
"It's a glorious thing to lie here on deck and do nothing !"&#xD;
he said, extending his elegantly clad limbs rather more into&#xD;
the distance. "how fine the breeze is, doctor-what do&#xD;
you think of the day, as a whole ?"&#xD;

"Unfinished, at present1&#xD;
"Well-'7 said Mr. Motley,.-..-." take that part of it Which&#xD;
you with such precision term 'this moment',.-.-..what do you&#xD;
think of it as it appears here on deck ?"&#xD;
"S unny-.." said the doctor,-" and we are flies. On the&#xD;
whole I think it's a bore, Motley."&#xD;
"What do you think of the Black Hole of Calcutta, in&#xD;
comparison ?" said Mr. Motley closing his eyes.&#xD;
"The difference is, that that would have been an insuffer.&#xD;
able bore."&#xD;
Mr. Motley smiled stroking his chin with affectionate&#xD;
fingers. "On the whole," he said, "I think you're right&#xD;
in that position. What do you suppose Linden's about 'at&#xD;
this moment' ?"&#xD;
"Is he your ward ?" said the doctor.&#xD;
"He's down below-" said Mr. Motley with a significant&#xD;
pointing of his train of remarks. "By which I don't&#xD;
mean! that he's left this planet.--.for truly, when he does I&#xD;
think it will be in a different direction; but he's down in&#xD;
the steerage-trying to get some of those creatures to&#xD;
follow him."&#xD;
"Which way ?"&#xD;
"You and George Alcott have such a snappish thread in&#xD;
you 1" said Mr. Motley yawning-... "only it sits better on&#xD;
George than it does on you. But I like it -it rather&#xD;
excites me to be snubbed. However, here comes Linden......&#xD;
so I hope they'll not follow him this way."&#xD;
'This way' Mr. Linden himself did not come but chose&#xD;
another part of the deck for a somewhat prolonged walk&#xD;
in the seabreeze. The doctor glanced towards him, then&#xD;
moved his chair slightly, so as to put the walker out of his&#xD;
range of vision.&#xD;
He's a good fellow enough," he remarked carelessly.&#xD;
"You were pleased to speak of him just now as 'incompre-&#xD;
hensible'....-..may I ask how he has earned a title to that ?"&#xD;
The tone was a little slighting.&#xD;
"Take the last instance--." said Mr. Motley, - "you&#xD;
yourself were pleased to pronounce the steerage a more&#xD;
insufferable bore than the deck-yet he chooses it,--.and&#xD;
not only on Sundays. I don't believe there's a day that he&#xD;
don't go down there. He's popular enough without it--..&#xD;
&#xD;
't1g~'t that. And nobody knows it--one of the sailors told&#xD;
me. If he was a medico, like you, doctor, there'd be less&#xD;
wonder-but as it is !---" and Mr. Motley resigned himself&#xD;
again to the influence of the sunshine. A moment's medi-&#xD;
tation on the doctor's part, to judge by his face, was delect-&#xD;
able.&#xD;
"There isn't any sickness down there ?" he said then.&#xD;
"Always is in the steerage - isn't there ?" said Mr. Mot-&#xD;
ley,-" I don't know !-the surgeon can tell you."&#xD;
"There's no occasion, ---" said the doctor with a little&#xD;
haughtiness. "He knows who I am."&#xD;
And Dr. Harrison too resigned himself; apparently, to the&#xD;
sunny influences of the time and was silent.&#xD;
But as the sun went down lower and lower, Mr. Motley&#xD;
roused himself up and went off to try the effect upon his&#xD;
spirits of a little cheerful society,-then Mr. Linden came&#xD;
and took the vacant chair.&#xD;
"How beautiful it is !" he said in a tone that was half&#xD;
greeting, half meditation. The start with which Dr. Har-&#xD;
rison heard him was skilfully transformed into a natural&#xD;
change of position.&#xD;
"Beautiful ?-yes," said he. "Has the beauty driven&#xD;
Motley away ?"&#xD;
UHe is gone.--Your waves are very dazzling to-night,&#xD;
doctor."&#xD;
"They are helping us on," said the doctor looking at&#xD;
them. "We shall be in after two days more --if this&#xD;
holds."&#xD;
Helping us on-perhaps the thought was not unqualified&#xD;
in Mr. Linden's mind, for he considered that---or something&#xD;
else-in grave silence for a minute or two.~&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison," he said suddenly, "you asked me about&#xD;
my course - I wish you would tell me yours. Towards&#xD;
what--.-for what. You bade me call myself a friend-may&#xD;
I use a friend's privilege ?" He spoke with a grave, frank&#xD;
earnestness.&#xD;
The doctor's face showed but a small part of the aston-&#xD;
ishment which this speech raised. It showed a little.&#xD;
"I can be but flattered !--" he said with something of&#xD;
the old graceful medium between play and earnest. "You&#xD;
ask me what I am hardly wise enough to answer you. I&#xD;

am going to Paris, and you to Germany. After that, I really&#xD;
know about as much of one 'course' as of the other."&#xD;
"My question referred, not to the little daily revolutions&#xD;
but to the great life orbit. Harrison, what is yours to be ?"&#xD;
Evidently it was an uneasy question. Yet the power of&#xD;
influence-or of associations-..~---was such that Dr. Harriso11&#xD;
did not fling it away. "I remember," he said, not without&#xD;
some bitterness of accent-..."yout once did me the honour&#xD;
to profess to care."&#xD;
"I do care, very much." And one of the old looks,&#xD;
that Dr. Harrison well remembered-said the words were&#xD;
true.&#xD;
"You do me more honour than I do myself;" he said,&#xD;
not so lightly as he meant to say it. "I do not care. I&#xD;
see nothing to care for."&#xD;
"You refuse to see it-.-." Mr. Linden said gently and&#xD;
sorrowfully.&#xD;
Dr. Harrison's brow darkened-it might be with pain,&#xD;
for Mr. Linden's words were the echo of others he had&#xD;
listened to-not long ago. In a moment he turned and&#xD;
spoke with an impulse-of bravado? Perhaps he could&#xD;
not have defined, and his companion could not trace.&#xD;
"I refuse to see nothing !-but I confess to you I see&#xD;
nothing distinctly. What sort of an 'orbit' would you&#xD;
propose to me ?"&#xD;
The tone sounded frank, and certainly was not unkind.&#xD;
Mr. Linden's answer was in few words-" ' To them who by&#xD;
patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour&#xD;
and immortality, eternal life'."&#xD;
Dr. Harrison remained a little while with knitted brow&#xD;
looking down at his hands, which certainly were in an&#xD;
order to need no examination. Neither was he examining&#xD;
them. When he looked up again it was with the frankness&#xD;
and kindliness both more defined. Perhaps, very strange&#xD;
to his spirit, a little shame was at work there.&#xD;
"Linden," he said, "I believe in you! and if ever I enter&#xD;
upon an orbit of any sort, I'll take up yours. But-" said&#xD;
he relapsing into his light tone, perhaps of intent,-"you&#xD;
know two forces are necessary to keep a body going in one&#xD;
..-..and I assure you there is none, of any sort, at present a~&#xD;
work upon me I"&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are mistaken," said Mr. Linden,-" there are two."&#xD;
"Let's hear~-" said the doctor without looking at him.&#xD;
"In the first place your conscience, in the second your&#xD;
will."&#xD;
"You have heard of such things as both getting stagnant&#xD;
for want of use-haven't you ?"&#xD;
"I have heard of the one being half choked by the&#xD;
other," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"It's so warm this afternoon that I can't contradict you.&#xD;
What do you want me to do, Linden ?"&#xD;
"Let conscience do its work-and then you do yours.~~&#xD;
A minute's silence.&#xD;
"You do me honour, to believe I have such a thing as a&#xD;
conscience,"-said the doctor again a little bitterly. "I&#xD;
didn't use to think it, myself."&#xD;
He was unaware that it was that very ignored principle&#xD;
which had forced him to make this speech.&#xD;
"My. dear friend-" Mr. Linden began, and he too&#xD;
paused, looking off gravely towards the brightening hori-&#xD;
zon. "Then do yourself the honour to let conscience have&#xD;
fair play," he went on presently,-" it is too delicate a&#xD;
stream to bear the mountain torrents of unchecked will and&#xD;
keep its clearness."&#xD;
"Hum !-there's no system of drainage that ever I heard&#xD;
of that will apply up in those regions I" said the doctor,&#xD;
after again a second's delay to speak. "And you are doing&#xD;
my will too much honour now-I tell you it is in a state&#xD;
of stagnation, and I don't at present see any precipice tQ&#xD;
tumble down. When I do, I'll promise to think of you-&#xD;
if that thought isn't carried away too.-Come, Linden !"&#xD;
he said with more expression of kindliness than Mr. Linden&#xD;
had seen certainly during all the voyage before,-" I be~&#xD;
lieve in you, and I will !-though I suppose my words do&#xD;
seem to you no better than the very spray of those torrents&#xD;
you are talking about. Will you walk ?-Motley put me&#xD;
to sleep, but you have done one good thing-you have&#xD;
stirred me to desire action at least."&#xD;
It was curious, how the power of character, the power&#xD;
of influence, had borne down passion and jealousy-even&#xD;
smothered mortification and pride-and made the man of&#xD;
the world speak truth. Mr. Linden rose-yet did not im-&#xD;

mediateTy begin the walk; for laying one hand on the dec.&#xD;
tor's shoulder with a gesture that spoke both regard and&#xD;
sorrow and entreaty, he stood silently looking off at the&#xD;
colours in the west.&#xD;
"Dr. Harrison," he said, "I well believe that your mother&#xD;
and mine are dear friends in heaven-God grant that we&#xD;
may be, too !"&#xD;
Then they both turned, and together began their walk,&#xD;
It lasted till they were summoned to tea; and from that&#xD;
time till they got in there was no more avoidance of his&#xD;
old friend by the doctor. His manner was changed; if he&#xD;
did not find enjoyment in Mr. Linden's society he found&#xD;
somewhat else which had value for him. There was not&#xD;
again a shade of dislike or of repulsion; and when they&#xD;
parted on landing, though it might be that there lay in&#xD;
Dr. Harrison s secret heart a hope that he might never see&#xD;
Mr. Linden again, there lay with it also, as surely, a secret&#xD;
regret.&#xD;
Now all that Faith knew of this for a long time, was&#xD;
from a newspaper; where-among a crowd of unimportant&#xD;
passengers in the Vulcan's list-she read the names of Dr.&#xD;
Harrison and J. E. Linden.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
II and her mother sat alone at breakfast. About&#xD;
F A*IaTfortnight of grave quiet had followed after the joy-&#xD;
ous month that went before, with little enlivening, few in~&#xD;
terruptiOnS. Without, the season had bloon~ed into greater&#xD;
iuxuriance,-Within, the flowers now rarely came; and&#xD;
FaIth's flowerless dress and belt and hair, said of them~&#xD;
selves that Mr. Linden was away. Roses indeed peeped&#xD;
through the windows, and thrust their heads between the&#xD;
blinds, but no one invited them in.&#xD;
Not so peremptorily as the roses-and yet with more&#xD;
assurance of wetoome-iReuben Taylor knocked at the door&#xD;
during breakfast time; scattering the abstract musings that&#xD;
floated about the coffee-pot and mingled with its vapoury&#xD;
cloud.&#xD;
"Sit down, Reuben," said Faith jumping up ;-" there's&#xD;
a place for you;-and I'll give you a plate." To which&#xD;
Reuben only replied, "A letter, Miss Faith !"-and ~ntting&#xD;
it in her hands went off with quick steps. On the back of&#xD;
it was written, up in one corner-" Flung on board the&#xD;
Polar Bear, by a strong hand, from steamship Vulcan, half&#xD;
way across."&#xD;
There was no need of flowers now truly in the house,&#xD;
for Faith stood by the table transformed into a rose of&#xD;
summer joy.&#xD;
"Mother !" she exclaimed,-.-" It's from sea-half way&#xD;
across."-&#xD;
"From sea !-half way across-" her mother repeated.&#xD;
"Why child, what are you talking about? You don't mean&#xD;
that il\'Ir. Linden's contrived to make a letter swim back&#xD;
here already, do you ?"&#xD;
Faith hardly heard. A minute she stood, with her eyes&#xD;
very like what Mr. Motley had graphically described them&#xD;
to be, breaking the seal with hurried fingers, .-and then ran&#xD;
away. The breakfast table and Mrs. Derrick waited-they&#xD;
waited a long time before Faith came back to eat a cold    YI&#xD;

breakfast;, which tasted of nothing but sea-breezes and Wa~&#xD;
therefore very strengthening. The strengthening eff~ec~&#xD;
went through the day; there was a fresh colour in Faith's&#xD;
face. Fifty tines at least the "moonbeams" of her eyes&#xD;
saw a "strong hand" throw her packet across the sea&#xD;
waves that separated the two. steamers; the master of the&#xD;
"Polar Bear" might guess, but Faith knew, that a strong&#xD;
heart had done it as well. And when her work was over&#xD;
Faith put a rose in her belt in honour of the day, and sat&#xD;
down to her books, very happy.&#xD;
The books were engrossing, and it was later than usual&#xD;
when she came down stairs to get tea, but Mrs. Derrick&#xD;
was out. That wasn't very strange. Faith went through&#xD;
the little routine of preparation,-then she took another&#xD;
book and sat down by the sweet summer air of the open&#xD;
window to wait. By and by Mrs. Derrick came slowly&#xD;
down the road, opened and shut the gate with~the same air&#xD;
of abstracted deliberateness, and came up the steps looking&#xD;
tired and flushed. In the porch Faith met and kissed her.&#xD;
"Where have you been now, mother? tea's ready."&#xD;
"Pretty child !" was Mrs. Derrick's answer7 "how glad I&#xD;
am you got that letter this morning !"&#xD;
Faith smiled; she didn't forget it, but it was not to be&#xD;
expected that it should be quite so present to Mrs. Der~&#xD;
rick's mind. Yet almost at the same instant she felt that&#xD;
her mother had some particular reason for saying that just&#xD;
then.&#xD;
* "Where have you been, mother ?"&#xD;
"Up to Squire Stoutenburgh's," said Mrs. Derrick~ put.&#xD;
ting herself wearily in the rockiug-chair,-J'and they were&#xD;
all out-gone to Pequot to spend the day. So I lost my&#xD;
labour."&#xD;
Gently Faith stood before her and took off her bonnet.&#xD;
"What did you go there for, mother ?"&#xD;
"I wanted to see him-" said MrsriPerrick. "Squire&#xD;
Deacon's been here, Faith."&#xD;
"Mother! Is he back again ?-.-What for.?"&#xD;
"Settle here and live, I suppose. lie's married-that's&#xD;
one thing. What was he here for ?~z~..why the old story,&#xD;
Faith,-he wants the place." And Mrs. Derrick'~ eyes&#xD;
looked as if she wanted it too.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Does he want it very much, mother ?"&#xD;
"Means to have it, child-and I don~t feel as if I could&#xD;
live in any other house in Pattaquasset. So I thought&#xD;
maybe Mr.. Stoutenburgh would make him hold off till next&#xD;
year, Faith," said Mrs. Derrick, a little smile coming back&#xD;
to her lips. "I guess I'll go up again after tea."&#xD;
Faith coaxed her mother into the other room aj~nd gave&#xD;
her her tea daintily; revolving in her mind the while many&#xD;
things. When tea was over and Mrs. Derrick was again&#xD;
bent upon business, Faith ventured a question. "Mother,&#xD;
what do you suppose Squire Stoutenburgh can do to 'help&#xD;
us&#xD;
"I can't tell, child,-he might talk Sam Deacon into let-&#xD;
ting us keep the house, at least. We've got to live some-&#xD;
where, you know, Faith. It's no sort of use for me to talk&#xD;
to him,-he's as stiff as a crab tree .-and I aint. Ii think&#xD;
I'll try."&#xD;
"To-night, mother ?"&#xD;
"I thought I would."&#xD;
Faith hesitated, putting the cups together. "Mother,&#xD;
I'll go. I dare say I shall do as well."&#xD;
"I'm afraid you're tired too, pretty child," said Mrs. Der-&#xD;
rick, but with evident relief at the very idea.&#xD;
"I tired ?-Never," said Faith. "You rest, mother -&#xD;
and don't fear," she added, kissing her. "I'll put on my&#xD;
bonnet-and be there and back again in a little while."&#xD;
The summer twilight was falling grey, but Faith knew&#xD;
she could have a guardian to come home; and besides the&#xD;
road between the two houses was thickly built up and per-&#xD;
feetly safe. The evening glow was almost gone, the stars&#xD;
faintly gleaming out in the blue above; a gentle sea breeze&#xD;
stirred the branches and went along with Faith on~her errand.&#xD;
Now was this errand grievously unpleasing to Faith, simply&#xD;
because of the implication of that one year of reprieve&#xD;
which she must ask for. How should she manage it? But&#xD;
her way was clear; she must manage it as she could.&#xD;
Spite of this bugbear, she had gone with a light free&#xD;
step all along her road, walking rather quick; for other&#xD;
thoughts had kept her company, and the image of her little&#xD;
flying packet shot once and again through her mind. At&#xD;
length she came to Mr. Stoutenburgh's gate, and Faith's&#xD;

foot paused. Light shone though the muslin curtains;&#xD;
and as her step neared the front door the broken sounds of&#xD;
voices and laughter came unwelcomely through. A rn~ost&#xD;
unnecessary formality her knock was, but one of the chil.&#xD;
dren came to the door and ushered her at once into the&#xD;
tearoom, where the family were waiting for their late tea,&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh-4ooking very pretty in her light sum.&#xD;
mer dress-was half reclining on the sofa, professing that&#xD;
she was tired to death, but quite failing to excite any syrn.&#xD;
pathy thereby in the group of children who had not seen&#xD;
her since morning. The Squire himself walked leisurely&#xD;
up and down, with his hands behind him, sometimes laugh.&#xD;
ing at the children sometimes helping on their play. Through&#xD;
the room was the full perfume of roses, and the lamplight&#xD;
could not yet hide the departing glow of the western hori-&#xD;
zon. Into this group and atmosphere little Linda brought&#xD;
the guest, with the simple announcement, "Mother, it's Miss&#xD;
Faith."&#xD;
"Miss Faith !" Mrs. Stoutenburgh exclaimed, starting up&#xD;
and dispersing the young ones,-" Linda, you shall have a&#xD;
lump of sugar !-My dear other child, how do you do ?-.&#xD;
and what sweet corner of your little heart sent you up here&#xD;
to-night? You have not-no, that can't be,-and you&#xD;
wouldn't come here if you had. But dear Faith, how are&#xD;
you ?"-ai4 she was rescued from the Squire and carried&#xD;
oft' to the sofa to answer at her leisure. With a sort of&#xD;
blushing, steadfast grace, which was common with her in the&#xD;
company of friends who were in her secret, Faith answered.&#xD;
"And you haven't had tea yet,"-she said remorsefully.&#xD;
"I came to give Mr. Stoutenburgh some trouble-but I can&#xD;
do it in three minutes." Faith looked towards the Squire.&#xD;
"My dear," he said, "it would take you three years !"&#xD;
"But Faith," said Mrs. Stoutenburgh-" here comes the&#xD;
tea, and you can't go home without Mr. Stoutenburgh,-..&#xD;
and nothing qualifies him for business like a contented state&#xD;
of his appetite I"&#xD;
Faith laughed and sat down again, and then was fain&#xD;
upon persuasion to take a place at the table, which was a&#xD;
joyous scene enough. Faith did little but fill a place; her&#xD;
mind was busy with thoughts that began to come pressingly;&#xD;
she tried not to~ have it seem so.&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
"My dear," said the Squire as he helped Faith to rasp-&#xD;
berries, "what fine weather we have had,. eh ?"&#xD;
"Beautiful weather 1".- Faith responded with a little&#xD;
energy.&#xD;
"Papa," said one of the children, "do you think Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den's had it fine too ?"&#xD;
"What tangents children's minds go off in !" observed&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh. "Faith! don't eat your raspberries&#xD;
without sugar, -how impatient you are. You used to&#xD;
preach patience to me when I was sick."&#xD;
"I can be very patient, with these raspberries and no&#xD;
sugar," said Faith, wishing she could hide the bloom of her&#xD;
cheeks as easily as she hid that of the berries under the fine&#xD;
white shower.&#xD;
"Poor child !" said her friend gently,-" I think you have&#xD;
need of all your patience~" And her hands came softly&#xD;
about Faith's plate, removing encumbrances and adding&#xD;
dainties, with a sort of mute sympathy that at the moment&#xD;
could find no more ethereal channel. "Mr. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
drove down to Quapaw the other day," she went on in a&#xD;
low voice, "to ask those fishing people what indications&#xD;
our land weather gave of the weather at sea; and-he&#xD;
couldn't half tell me about his visit when he came home,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Stoutenburgh, breaking short off in her account.&#xD;
"Linda, go get that glass of white roses and set it by Miss&#xD;
Faith,.-maybe she'll take, them home with her."&#xD;
Faith looked at the white roses and smelled their sweet~&#xD;
ness; and then she said, ~' Who did you see, Mr. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh ?-down at Quapafr ?"&#xD;
"None of the men, my dear-they were all away, but II&#xD;
saw half the rest of the village; and even the children knew&#xD;
what report the men hadb ron ght in, and what they thought&#xD;
of the weather. Everybody had a good word to say about&#xD;
it, Miss Faith; and everybody-I do believe I" said the&#xD;
Squire reverently, "had been on their knees to pray for it.&#xD;
Jonathan Ling's wife said that was all they could ever do.&#xD;
for him." Which pronoun, be it understood, did not refer&#xD;
to Jonathan Ling.&#xD;
"They're Mr. Linden's roses, Miss Faith," said little&#xD;
Linda, who stood waiting for more marked admiration,-&#xD;
"do you like them? He always did."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="352-353" xml:id="VAC8220-00000177"/>&#xD;
352              SAY AND SEAL.                                  SAY AND SEAL.              353&#xD;
&#xD;
Faith kissed the child, partly to thank her and to stop&#xD;
her lips, partly to hide her own which she felt were tale.&#xD;
telling.&#xD;
"Where did you get the roses, Linda ?"&#xD;
"0 off the bush in the garden. But Mr. Linden always&#xD;
picked one whenever he came,' and sometimes he'd stop o~&#xD;
his way to school, and just open the gate and get one of&#xD;
these white roses and then go away again. So we called&#xD;
it Mr. Linden's bush." Faith endeavoured to attend to her&#xD;
raspberries after this. When tea was over she was carried&#xD;
off into the drawing~room and the children were kept out,&#xD;
"If you want me away too, Faith," Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
said as she arranged the lamp and the curtains, "I'll go."&#xD;
"I don't want you to go, ma'ain."-.--And then covering&#xD;
her trepidation under the simplest of grave exteriors, Faith&#xD;
spoke to the point. "it is mother's business. Squire Dea-&#xD;
con has come home, Mr. Stoutenburgh."&#xD;
"My dear," said the Squire, "I know he has. I heard it&#xD;
just before you came in. But he's married, Miss Faith."&#xD;
"That don't content him," said Faith, "for he wants our&#xD;
farm."&#xD;
"Rascal U' said Mr. Stoutenburgh in an emphatic under.&#xD;
tOne,-." the old claim, I suppose. 'What's the state of it&#xD;
now, my dear?"'&#xD;
"Nothing new, sir; he has a right to it, I suppose. The&#xD;
mortgage is owing, and we haven't been able to pay any-&#xD;
thing ~ut the interest, and that must be a small rent for The&#xD;
farm." Faith paused. Mrs. Stoutenburgh was silent, look.&#xD;
lug from one to the other an~iously,.-the Squire himself&#xD;
was not very intelligible.&#xD;
"Yes".-.he said,-." of course. Your poor father only lived&#xD;
to make the second payment. I don't know why I call him&#xD;
poor-he's rich enough now. But Sam Deacon !-.-.-a small&#xD;
rent? too much for him to get,.-.and too little..-..Why&#xD;
my dear !" he said suddenly sitting up straight and facing&#xD;
round upon Faith, "I thought-What does ~your mother&#xD;
expect to do, Miss Faith ?-has she seen Sam? What does&#xD;
he say ?"&#xD;
came to see her this afternoon, sir-he is bent upon&#xD;
having the place, mother says. And she - don't like to&#xD;
leave the old house," Faith said slowly. "He will take the&#xD;
&#xD;
K farm, I suppose,.-but mother thought, perhaps, sir-if you&#xD;
speak to Mr. Deacon, he would let us stay in the&#xD;
house-Quly the house without anything else-for another&#xD;
year. Mother wished it-I don't know that your speaking'&#xD;
to him could do any good." Faith went straight through,&#xD;
but the rosy colour sprung and grew till its crimson reached&#xD;
her forehead. Not the less she went clearly through with&#xD;
what she had to say, her eyes only at the last words droop-&#xD;
ing. Mr. Stoutenburgh rose up with great energy and&#xD;
~t~od before her.&#xD;
"My dear," he said, "he shall do it! If it was any other&#xD;
man I'd promise to make him do more, but Sam always&#xD;
must have some way of amusing himself, and I'm afraid I&#xD;
can't make this as expensive as the last one he tried. You&#xD;
tell your mother, Miss Faith, that she shall stay in her&#xD;
house till she'd rather go to yours. I hope that won't be&#xD;
more than a year, but if it is she shall stay."&#xD;
"That's good, Mr. Stoutenburgh I" said his wife with a&#xD;
little clap of her hands.&#xD;
Whether Faith thought it was 'good' might be a 4ues~&#xD;
~ tion; her eyes fell further, she did not offer to thank Mr.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh for his energetic kindness, nor to say any-&#xD;
thing. Yet Faith had seemingly more to say, for she made&#xD;
no motion to go. She sat quite still a few minutes, till&#xD;
raising her eyes fully to Mr. Stoutenburgh's face she said&#xD;
gravely, "Mother will feel very glad when I tell. her that,&#xD;
sir.&#xD;
"She may make herself easy. But tell her, my dear,"&#xD;
~ said the Squire, again forgetting in his earnestness what&#xD;
~ ground lie was on,-" tell her she's on no account to tell&#xD;
~ Sam why she wants to stay. Will you recollect that,&#xD;
Miss Faith ?"&#xD;
Faith's eyes opened slightly. "I think he must know-&#xD;
or guess it, Mr. Stoutenburgh? Mother says she could&#xD;
hardly bear to live in any other house in Pattaquasset."&#xD;
"My dear Miss Faith !" said Mr. Stoutenburgh,-" I&#xD;
mean !-why she don't want to stay any longer. That's&#xD;
what Sam mustn't know. I'm very stupid about my words,1&#xD;
always."&#xD;
Faith was again obliged to wait a few minutes before&#xD;
she could go on. Mrs. Stoutenburgh was the first to speak,&#xD;

&#xD;
for the Squire walked up and down, no doubt (mentally)&#xD;
attacking Mr. Deacon.&#xD;
"I'm so glad !" she said, with the old dance of her eyes~.&#xD;
and yet a little sigh too. "So glad and so happy, that I&#xD;
could cry,-I know I shall when the time comes. Dear&#xD;
Faith, do you feel quite easy about this other busiue~&#xD;
now?"&#xD;
"What, ma'am ?-about Mr. Deacon ?"&#xD;
"Why yes !" said Mrs. Stoutenburgh laughing,~"isn~&#xD;
that the only one you've been uneasy about ?"&#xD;
"I am not uneasy now," said Faith. "But ~ Stout.&#xD;
enburgh-if Mr. Deacon takes the farm back again, whoni&#xD;
does the hay belong to, aud the cattle, and the tools and&#xD;
farm things ?"&#xD;
"All that's on the land-all that's growing on it, goes&#xD;
with it. All that's under cover and moveable belongs to&#xD;
you.~'&#xD;
"Then the hay in the barn is ours ?"&#xD;
"Everything in the barn."&#xD;
"There's a good deal in the barn'," said Faith with a&#xD;
brightening face. "You know the season has been early,&#xD;
sir, and our hay-fields lie well to the sun; and a great deal&#xD;
of the hay is in. Mr. Deacon will want some rent for the&#xD;
house I suppose,-and I guess there will be hay enough to&#xD;
pay it, whatever it is. For I can't sell my cows ! -" she&#xD;
added laughing a little.&#xD;
Her tWo friends-the Squire on the floor and his wife on&#xD;
the sofa-looked at her and then at each other.&#xD;
"My dear," the Squire began, "IF want to ask you a&#xD;
question. And before I do, let me tell you-which per.&#xD;
haps you don't know-just what right I"-&#xD;
"Oh Mr. Stoutenburgh !" cried his wife, "do please&#xD;
hush !-you'll say something dreadful."&#xD;
"Not a bit of it-" said the Squire,-" I know what to&#xD;
say this time, my dear, and when to stop. I wanted to tell&#xD;
you, Miss Faith, that I am your regularly appointed guar-&#xD;
dian-therefore if I ask questions you will understand why."&#xD;
But what more on that subject the Squire might have said,&#xD;
and said not, was left to conjecture. Faith looked at him,&#xD;
wondering, coloring, doubting.&#xD;
"I never heard of it before, sir," she said,&#xD;
&#xD;
You shouldn't; say regularly, Mr. Stoutenburgh," said&#xD;
his wife,-" Faith will think she is to be under your control."&#xD;
"I shouldn't say legally," said the Squire, "and I didn't.&#xD;
No she aint under my control. I only mean, Miss Faith,"&#xD;
he said turning to her, "that I am appointed to look after&#xD;
your interests1 till somebody who is better qualified comes&#xD;
to do it."&#xD;
"There-Mr. Stoutenburgh,-don't go any further," said&#xD;
his wife.&#xD;
"iNot in that direction," said the Squire. "Now my&#xD;
dear, if Sam Deacon will amuse himself in this way, as J&#xD;
said, what will you do? Do the farm and the house about&#xD;
counterbalance each other most years?"&#xD;
Faith never knew how she separated the two parts of her&#xD;
nature enough at this moment to be practical, but she&#xD;
answered. "We have been able to pay the interest on the&#xD;
mortgage, sir, every year. That's all. Mother has not laid&#xD;
up anything."&#xD;
The Squire took a turn or two up and down the room,&#xD;
then came and stood before her again. "My dear," he&#xD;
said, "you can't, tell just yet what your plans will be, so I&#xD;
won't ask you to-night, but you had better let me deal with&#xD;
Sam Deacon, and the new tenant, and the hay, and every-&#xD;

more solid, to any amount you please."&#xD;
"Something more solid than yourself 1-0 Mr. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh !" his wife said, though her eyes were bright with&#xD;
more than one feeling.&#xD;
Faith was silent a minute, and then gave Mr. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh a full view of those steady eyes that some people&#xD;
liked and some did not care just so to meet.&#xD;
"No, sir !-" she said with a smile and also a little wist-&#xD;
ful look of the gratitude she did not speak, - "if the hay&#xD;
will pay the rent, I don't want anything else. Mother and&#xD;
I can do very well. We will be very much obliged to you&#xD;
to manage Mr. Deacon for us-and the hay. I think I can&#xD;
manage the rest. II shall keep the cows and make butter,"&#xD;
-she' said with a laughing flash of the eye.&#xD;
"0 delicious !" cried Mrs. Stoutenburgh, "(I mean the&#xD;
butter, Faith)-but will you let me have it ?"&#xD;
"You don't want it," said Faith.&#xD;
&#xD;

"I do ! -nobody makes such butter-I should eat my&#xD;
breakfast with a new appetite, and so would Sam. W0&#xD;
never can get butter enough when he's in the house. i'n&#xD;
send down for it three times a week-how often do you&#xD;
churn, Faith ?"&#xD;
Faith came close up to her~ and kissed her as she whis.&#xD;
pered laughingly, "Every day !"&#xD;
"Then I'll send every day !" said Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
clapping her hands. "And then I shall hear of you Once&#xD;
in a while.-Ungrateful child, you haven't been here before&#xD;
since-I suppose it won't do to say when," she added, kiss-&#xD;
ing Faith on both cheeks. "I shall tell Mr. Linden it is&#xD;
not benevolent to pet you so much."&#xD;
"But my dear-my dear-" said the Squire from one to&#xD;
the other. "Well, well,-- I'll talk to you another time,&#xD;
Miss Faith,-I can't keep up with more than one lady at&#xD;
once. You and Mrs. Stoutenhurgh have gone on clean&#xD;
ahead of me."&#xD;
"What's the matter', Mr. Stoutenburgh ?" said Faith. "I&#xD;
would like to hoar it now, for there is something I want&#xD;
settled."&#xD;
"What's that ?" said the Squire.&#xD;
"Will you please go on, sir ?"&#xD;
"I guess I'll hear you first," said the Squire. "You&#xD;
seem to know just what you want to say, Miss Faith, and&#xD;
I'm not sure that I do."&#xD;
"You said we had gone on ahead of you, sir. Shall we&#xD;
go back now&#xD;
"Why my dear," said the Squire smiling, "I thought you&#xD;
two were settling up accounts and arrangements rather fast,&#xD;
that's all. If they are the beginning and end, that's very&#xD;
~ve1l; but if they're only premonitory symptoms, that again's&#xD;
different."&#xD;
"And not 'very well' ?" said Faith, waiting.&#xD;
"Not very," said Mr. Stoutenburgh shaking his head.&#xD;
"How should it be better, sir ?"&#xD;
"My dear, in general, what is needless can be spared."&#xD;
"I don't know what I am going to do, Mr. Stouten-&#xD;
burgh. I am going to do nothing needless, not wilfully&#xD;
needless. But I am going to do it without help." She&#xD;
stood before him, with perfect gentleness but with as clear&#xD;
&#xD;
determination in both look and manner, making her means&#xD;
~ ing known. Mrs. Stoutenburgh laughed, the Squire stood&#xD;
looking at her in a smiling perplexity. Finally went straight&#xD;
to the point.&#xD;
"Miss Faith, it is doubly needless that you should do&#xD;
anything more than you've been doing-everybody knows&#xD;
that's enough. In the first place, my dear, you are your&#xD;
father's child-and that's all that need be said, till my purse&#xD;
has a hole at both ends. In the next place-shall I tell&#xD;
her what she is in the next place, Mrs. Stoutenburgh ?"&#xD;
"I fancy she knows," said his wife demurely.&#xD;
"Well," said the Squire, "the next place is the first place,&#xD;
after all, and I haven't the right to do much but take care&#xD;
of her. But my dear, I have it under hand and seal to&#xD;
take better care than that."&#xD;
"Than what, sir ?".--said Faith with very deep colour,&#xD;
but unchanged bearing.&#xD;
"I don't know yet," said Mr. Stoutenburgh, ~~aNuy more&#xD;
than you know what you are going to do. Than to let you&#xD;
do anything that would grieve your dear friend and mine.&#xD;
If I could shew you the letter you'd understand, Miss&#xD;
Faith, but I'm not good at repeating. 'To take care of you%&#xD;
as he would'-that was part of it. And because I can't&#xD;
half carry out such instructions, is no sign I shouldn't do it&#xD;
a quarter." And the Squire stood as firm on his ground as&#xD;
Faith on hers.&#xD;
No, not quite; for in her absolute gentleness there was a&#xD;
power of intent expressed, which, rougher outlines could but&#xD;
give with less emphasis. The blood spoke for her eloquently&#xD;
before Faith could find any sort of words to speak for her-&#xD;
self brought now by more feelings than one; 'yet still she&#xD;
stood before the Squire, drooping her head a little, a soft&#xD;
statue of immoveability. Only once, just before she spoke,&#xD;
both Faith's hands went up to her brow to push the hair&#xD;
back ;-a most unusual gesture of agitation. But her look&#xD;
and her words were after the same steady fashion as before,&#xD;
aggravated by a little wicked smile, and Faith's voice&#xD;
sounded for sweetness like silver bells.&#xD;
"You can't do it, Mr. Stoutenburgh ! -not that way.&#xD;
Take care of me every other way ;-but I'll not have-of&#xD;
that sort-a bit of help. "---~&#xD;

SAY AND SEA.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Squire looked at her with a mixture of amusement&#xD;
and perplexity.&#xD;
"I'm to follow suit-" he said,-" but then I don't ju~&#xD;
know what Mr. Linden would do in such a case! Can yo~&#xD;
tell me, Miss Faith~"&#xD;
"It is no matter-it wouId~ not make any difference."&#xD;
"What would not ?" said the Squire innocently.&#xD;
"Anything that he could do, sir ;-so you have no chance."&#xD;
She coloured gloriously, but she smiled at him too with he~&#xD;
last words.&#xD;
"Well, Miss Faith," said Mr. Stoutenburgh, "I have my&#xD;
doubts as to the correctness of that first statement; but J'll&#xD;
tell you what 1 shall do, my refractory young lady. If yo~&#xD;
set about anything outside the limits, I'll do my best to&#xD;
thwart you,-there I"&#xD;
If Faith was not a match for him, there was no meaning&#xD;
in the laugh of her dark eye. But she only bade Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh an affectionate good night, took her bunch of&#xD;
white roses and Mr. Stoutenburgh's arm and set out to go&#xD;
home.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
,~ j~'AJTII put her roses in water and listened half ~ minute&#xD;
32 to their strange silent messages. But after that she&#xD;
did a great deal of thinking. If all went well, and Mr.&#xD;
Linden got home safe from .abroad,-and this year were all&#xD;
slic had to take care for, it was a very little matter to keep&#xD;
the year afloat, and very little matter, in her estimation,&#xD;
whatever she might have to do for the purpose. But those&#xD;
"ifs" no mortal could answer for. Faith did not look&#xD;
much at that truth, but she acted upon it; prayed over her&#xD;
thoughts and brought her plans into shape 4i very humble&#xD;
consciousness of it. And at the early breakfast the next&#xD;
*~ morning she began to unfold them; which as Mrs. IDerrick&#xD;
did not like them, led on to a long talk; but Faith as ustial&#xD;
iliad her way.&#xD;
After some preliminary arrangements, and late in the&#xD;
~ day, she set off upon a long walk to Miss iBezac's. The&#xD;
4 slant beams of the summer sun were again upon the trim&#xD;
~ little house as Faith came up towards it. Things were&#xD;
~ changed since she was there before! changed a good deaf&#xD;
fiom the gay, joyous playtime of that visit. Mr. Linden In&#xD;
* Europe, and she-" It is very well," thought Faith; "it&#xD;
might not have been good for me to have too much of such&#xD;
a time Next year"-&#xD;
~ Would if it brought joy, bring also an entering upon real&#xD;
~ life-work. Faith knew it; she had realized long before with a&#xD;
~ thought of pain, that this summons to Europe had perhaps&#xD;
cut short her last time of absolute holiday pleasure. Mr.&#xD;
Linden could hardly now be more than a few days in P~t~&#xD;
~ taquasset before "next year" should corne~-and Faith did&#xD;
~ not stop to look at that; she never thought of it three&#xD;
minutes together. But life-work looked to her lovely ;-~&#xD;
what did not? Even the little pathway to Miss Bezac's&#xD;
door was pleasant. She was secretly glad of that other&#xD;
visit now, which had made this one so easy; though yet a&#xD;
sympathetic blush started as she went in.&#xD;

it&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why Faith 1" said Miss Bezac,-~."you're the very per.&#xD;
son I was thinking of; and the very one I wanted to see~&#xD;
though I always do want to see you, for that matter, and&#xD;
don't often get what I want. Then I don't generally want&#xD;
much. But what a beautiful visit we had last time! ~&#xD;
you know I've been conjuring ever since how your dress&#xD;
should be made? What'll it be, to begin with ?.-I always&#xD;
do like to begin with that-and it's bothered me a good&#xD;
deal-not knowing it, I mean. I couldn't arrange so well&#xD;
about the making. Because making white satin's one thing,&#xD;
and muslin's another,-and lace is different from 'em both&#xD;
.-and indeed from most other things except spider's webs,"&#xD;
All which pleasant and composing sentiments were uttered&#xD;
while Miss Bezac was clearing a chai~' for Faith, and put.&#xD;
lAng her in it, and laying her various pieces of work&#xD;
together.&#xD;
"I shouldn't be the least bit f help to you," said Faith&#xD;
who couldn't help laughing. "Can't it wait ?"&#xD;
"Why it'll have to," said Miss Bezac; "he said it must,&#xD;
-but that's no reason I should. I always like a reason&#xD;
for everything. It took me an age and a quarter to find&#xD;
out why Miss Essie De Staff always will wear aprons. She&#xD;
wears 'em out, too, in more ways than one, but that's g.ood&#xD;
for me. Only there's so many ways of making them that&#xD;
I get in a puzzle. Now this one, Faith-would you work&#xD;
it with red flowers or green ?-I said black, but she will&#xD;
have colours. You've got a good colour to-day-O don't&#xD;
you want some bread and milk ?" said Miss Bezac, dropping&#xD;
the apron.&#xD;
"No, thank you 1" said Faith laughing again,-.J'not to.&#xD;
day. I should work that with green, Miss Bezac."&#xD;
"But I'm afraid green won't do, with black above and&#xD;
black below," said Miss Bezac. "Two sides t~ things you&#xD;
know, Faith,-aprons and all the rest. I'd a great mind to&#xD;
work it with both, and then she couldn't say she'd rather&#xD;
have had othere. What things I have worked in my day!&#xD;
.-but my day's twilight now, and my eyes find it out."&#xD;
"Do you have more to do than you can manage, gen.&#xD;
rally ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"Why no, child, because I never take any more,-that's&#xD;
the way not to have things-troubles or aprons. I could&#xD;
&#xD;
have my hands full of both, but what's the use ?-when one&#xD;
hasn't eyes-for sewing or crying. Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
comes, and Mrs. Somers, and Miss Essie-and the land-&#xD;
lord, and sometimes I let 'em leave me a job, and sometimes&#xD;
I don't,-Send 'em, dresses, and all, off to Quilipeak."&#xD;
*" Then I'll tell you what you shall give me to-day~in~&#xD;
stead of bread and milk ;-some of the work that you&#xD;
would send off. Don't you remember," said Faith, smiling&#xD;
quietly at Miss Bezac's eyes,---" you once promised to teach&#xD;
me to embroider waistcoats ?"&#xD;
"Why yes 1" said Miss J3ezac-." and so I will. But,&#xD;
my dear, are you sure he would wear it ?-and after all,&#xD;
isn't it likely he'll get everything of that sort he wants, in&#xD;
Paris? And then the size 1-who's to tell what that should&#xD;
be ~ To he sure you could do the fronts, and have theni&#xD;
made up afterwards-and of course he would wear any~&#xD;
thing you made.-I'll go right off and get my patterns."&#xD;
Faith's confusion was startled. It was Miss Bezac's&#xD;
turn to look at her. She caught hold of the seamstress&#xD;
and brought her back to listening at least.&#xD;
"Stop !-Miss Bezac !-.-you don't understand me. I&#xD;
want work !-.I want work. I am not talking of making&#xD;
anything for anybody !-" Faith's eyes were truthful now,&#xD;
if ever they were.&#xD;
"Well then-how can you work, if you won't make any~&#xD;
thing for anybody? Want work, Faith ?-you don't mean&#xD;
to say all that story about Sam Deacon's true? Do yort&#xD;
know," said Miss Bezac, dropping into a chair and folding&#xD;
her hands, "when I heard that man had gone out of town,&#xD;
I said to myself; it would be a mercy if he never came&#xD;
back !"-which was the severest censure Miss Bezac ever&#xD;
passed upon anybody. "I really did," she went on, -&#xD;
"and now he's come, and I s'pose I've got to say that's a&#xD;
mercy too-and this,-though I wouldn't believe it last;&#xD;
night."&#xD;
"Then you have heard it ?"&#xD;
"My ears did, and they're pretty good ears too,-though&#xD;
I do get out of patience with them now and then."&#xD;
"It's true," said Faith, "and it's nothing very dreadful.&#xD;
Mother and I have nothing to live upon but what I can&#xD;
make by butter; so I thought I would learn and take wor1~&#xD;

of you, if you had it for me. I could soon understand it;&#xD;
and then you can let people bring you as much as they will&#xD;
-what you cannot do, I will do. I could think of nothing&#xD;
so pleasant ;-.---io way to make money, I mean."&#xD;
For a minute Miss Bezac sat quite still, -then she&#xD;
roused up.&#xD;
"Nothing to live upon but butter !"-she ~aid,-" well&#xD;
that's not much,-at least if there's ever so much of it yo~ 4&#xD;
want something else. And what you~ want you must have&#xD;
-if you can get it. And I can get you plenty of work-. i&#xD;
and it's a good thing to understand this sort of work too, i&#xD;
for he might carry you off to some random place where&#xD;
they wear calico just as they can pint it on-and that&#xD;
wouldn't suit you, nor him neither. I don't believe thi&amp;amp;ll&#xD;
suit him though-and it don't me, not a bit. I'm as proud&#xD;
as a Lucifer match for anybody I love. But I'll make you&#xD;
pr6ud of your work in no time. What'll you do first? em-&#xD;
broider or stitch or cut out or baste or fit ?"&#xD;
"What you please -what you think best. But Miss&#xD;
Bezac, what are you 'proud' about ?"&#xD;
"0 I've my ways and means, like other folks," said Miss&#xD;
Bezac. "And you can do something more striking than&#xD;
aprons for people that don't need 'em. But I'm not going&#xD;
to give you this apron, Faith-.--I sha'n't have her wearing&#xD;
your work all round town, and none the wiser. See-this&#xD;
is nice and light and pretty-like the baby it's for,-you&#xD;
like green, don't you? and so will your eyes."&#xD;
"I'd as lieve have Miss Essie wear my work as eat my&#xD;
butter," said Faith. "But," she added more gravely,-." I ~&#xD;
think that what God gives me to do, I ought to be proud&#xD;
to do,-and I am sure I am willing. He knows best."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, my dear-I believe that,-and so I do most&#xD;
things you say," answered Miss Bezac, bringing forth from&#xD;
the closet a little roll of green calico. "Now do you like&#xD;
this ?--.-because if you don't, say so."&#xD;
"I'll take this," said Faith, "and the next time I'll take&#xD;
the apron. I must do just as much as I can, Miss Bezac;&#xD;
and you must let me. Would you rather have the apron&#xD;
done first? I want Miss Essie's apron, Miss Bezac !"&#xD;
"Well you can't have it," said Miss Bezac,-" and what&#xD;
you can't, you can't-.-.-all the world over. Begin slow and&#xD;
&#xD;
go on fast-that's the best way. And I'll take the best&#xD;
care of you !-lay you up in lavender,-like my work when&#xD;
it's done and isn't gone home."&#xD;
So laughingly they parted, and Faith went home with&#xD;
her little bundle of work, well contented.&#xD;
A very few days had seen the household retrenchments&#xD;
made. Cindy was gone, and Mr. Skip was only waiting&#xD;
for a 'boy' to come. Mother and daughter drew their&#xD;
various tools and conveniences into one room and the&#xD;
kitchen, down stairs, to have the less to take care of;&#xD;
abandoning the old eating-room except as a passage-way&#xD;
to the kitchen; and taking their meals, for greater conve-.&#xD;
nience, in the latter apartment.&#xD;
Faith did not shut up her books withot~t some great&#xD;
twinges of pain; but she said not one word on the matter.&#xD;
She bestowed on her stitching and on her hotisework and&#xD;
on her butter the diligent zeal which used to go into French&#xD;
rules and philosophy. But Mrs. Stoutenburgh had reckoned&#xD;
without her host, for there was a great deal more of the&#xD;
butter than she could possibly dispose of; and Judge Har-&#xD;
rison's family and Miss De Staff's became joint consumers&#xD;
and paid the highest price for it, that Faith would take.'&#xD;
J3ut this is running ahead of the story.&#xD;
Some days after Faith's appeal to Mr. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
had passed, before the Squire presented himself to report&#xD;
progress. He found both the ladies at work in the sitting-&#xD;
room, looking very much as usual, except that there was a&#xD;
certain not inelegant disposition of various pieces of muslin&#xD;
and silk and ribbon about the room which carried the&#xD;
appearance of business.&#xD;
"What rent will Mr. Deacon have, Mr. Stoutenburgh ?"&#xD;
said Faith looking up from her needle.&#xD;
"My dear, he'll have what he can get," said the Squire,&#xD;
"but what that'll be, Miss Faith, he and 1 haven't just made&#xD;
up our minds.&#xD;
"How much ought it to be, sir, do you think ?"&#xD;
"Nothing at all," said the Squire,-" not a cent."&#xD;
"Do you think not, sir ?" said Faith doubtfully.&#xD;
"Not a cent !" the Squire repeated,-" and I told~ him&#xD;
so, and said he might throw the barn into the bargain and&#xD;
not hurt himself,"&#xD;
&#xD;

"Will he agree to that, Mr. Stoutenburgh ?.-jII mean&#xD;

"My dear, ~ hope to make him agree to that, and more&#xD;
too. So just let the hay stand, and the house, and the&#xD;
barn, ~nd everything else for the present. I'll tell you time&#xD;
enough-if quarter day must come. And by the way,&#xD;
talking of quarters, there's one of a lamb we killed yester.&#xD;
day,.-J told Tim to leave it in the kitchen. How does&#xD;
your ice hold out?"&#xD;
"Do you want some, sir ?" said Faith, in whose eyes&#xD;
there shone a~ soft light the Squire could be at no loss to&#xD;
read.&#xD;
"No my dear, I don't-though Mrs. Stoutenburgh does&#xD;
tell me sometimes to~ keep cool. But I thought maybe&#xD;
you did. Do you know, Miss Essie De Staff never sees&#xD;
me now if she can help it-.what do you suppose is the&#xD;
reason ?"&#xD;
"I don't think there can be any, sir."&#xD;
"Must be !" said the Squire,-" always is a reason for&#xD;
every fact. You know what friends we used to be,.-it was&#xD;
always, 'Hush, Mr. Stoutenburgh!' or, 'how do you know&#xD;
anything about it?' Ah, he's a splendid fellow I-My dear,&#xD;
I don't wish to ask any impertinent questions, but when&#xD;
you do hear that he's safe across? just let me know-will&#xD;
you ?" And the Squire bowed himself off without waiting&#xD;
for an answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
VA ITII found that sewing and housework and butters&#xD;
12 making took not only, her hands but her minutes, and&#xD;
on these little minute wheels the days glided off very .fast.&#xD;
She had plenty of fresh air, withal, for Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
would coax her into a horseback ride, or the Squire take&#xD;
her off in his little wagon; or Mrs. Derrick and Jerry. go&#xD;
with her down to the shore for clams and salt water. The&#xD;
sea breeze was more company than usual, this summer.&#xD;
By the time August days came, there came also a letter&#xD;
from Europe; and thereafter the dispatches were as regu-&#xD;
lar and as frequent as the steamers. But they brought no&#xD;
special news as to the point of coming home. Mrs. Iredelt&#xD;
lingered on in the same uncertain state, neither worse nor&#xD;
better,-there was no news to send. Everything else the&#xD;
letters had; and though Faith might miss that, she could&#xD;
not complain.&#xD;
So the summer days slipped away peacefully; and when&#xD;
the mother and daughter sat sewing together in the after-&#xD;
noon, (for Mrs. Derrick often took some little skirt or&#xD;
sleeve) nobody would have guessed why the needles were&#xD;
at work.&#xD;
There was one remarkable thing about the boy Reuben&#xD;
tiad found to supply Mr. Skip's place-he was never visible.&#xD;
Nor audible either, for that matter, except that Faith at&#xD;
her own early rising often heard the wood-saw industriously&#xD;
in motion. He was not to sleep in the house for the first&#xD;
month,-that had been agreed; but whether he slept any-&#xD;
where seemed a matter of doubt. A doubt Faith resolved&#xD;
to set at rest; and one August morning, while the birds&#xD;
were a-twitter yet with their first getting up and the sun&#xD;
had not neared the horizon, Faith crossed the yard to, the.&#xD;
woodshed and stood in the open doorway, -the morning&#xD;
light showing the soft outlines of her figure in a dark print&#xD;
dress, and her 'white ruffles, and gleaming on her faultlessly&#xD;
soft and bright hair.&#xD;

The woodshed was in twilight yet; its various contents&#xD;
showing dimly, the phoebe who had built her nest under&#xD;
the low roof just astir, but the wood work was going on&#xD;
briskly. Not indeed under the saw-that lay idle; but&#xD;
with the sort of noiseless celerity which was natural to&#xD;
him, Reuben Taylor was piling the sticks of this or yester.&#xD;
day's cutting: the slight chafing of the wood as it fell into&#xD;
place chiming with the low notes of a hymn tune which&#xD;
Faith well remembered to hav&amp;amp; heard Mr. Linden sing.&#xD;
She did not stir, but softly, as she stood there, her voice&#xD;
joined in.&#xD;
For a minute Reuben did not hear her,..-...theu in some&#xD;
pause of arrangement he heard, and turned round with a&#xD;
start and flush that for degree might have suited one who&#xD;
was stealing wood instead of piling it. But he did not&#xD;
speak-nor eVen thought to say good morning; only&#xD;
pushed the back from his forehead and waited to&#xD;
receive sentence.&#xD;
"Reuben !"-said Faith, stepping in the doorway. And&#xD;
she said not another word; but in her eyes and her lips,&#xD;
even in her very attitude as she stood before him, Reuben&#xD;
Taylor might read it all !-her knowledge for whose love&#xD;
he was doing that work, her powerlessness of any present&#xD;
means of thanks, and the existence of a joint treasury of&#xD;
returned affection that would make itself known to him&#xD;
some day, if ever the chance were. The morning sun&#xD;
gleamed in through the doorway on her face, and Reuben&#xD;
could see it all there. He had raised ~his eyes at the first&#xD;
sound of her voice, but they fell again, and his only answer&#xD;
was a very low spoken "Good morning, Miss Faith."&#xD;
Faith sat down on a pile of cut sticks and looked up at&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Reuben.-what are you about ?"&#xD;
"Putting these sticks out of the way, Miss Faith"-with&#xD;
a half laugh then.&#xD;
"I shall tell Mr~ Linden of you," (gravely.)&#xD;
"I didn't mean you should have a chance; Miss ~&#xD;
"Now you are caught and found-do you know what&#xD;
your punishment will be ?"&#xD;
Reuben looked up again, but did not venture to guess.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You will be obliged to come in and take a cup of coffee&#xD;
with me every morning."&#xD;
"0 that's not necessary 1" Reuben said with a relieved&#xD;
face,-" thank you very much, Miss Faith."&#xD;
"It is necessary," said Faith gravely ~ and you are&#xD;
not to thank me for what you don't like."&#xD;
"It waS partly for what I do like, ma'am," said Reuben,&#xD;
softly pitching up a stick of hickory.&#xD;
"It's so pleasant to have you do this, Reuben," said&#xD;
Faith, watching him, "that I can't tell you how pleasant it&#xD;
is; but you must drink my coffee, Reuben, or-I will not&#xD;
burn your wood! You know what Mr. Linden would&#xD;
make you do, Reuben." Faith's voice lowered a little.&#xD;
Reuben did not dispute the commands so urged, though a&#xD;
quick glance said that her wish was enough.&#xD;
"But dear Reuben, who's coming when you're gone ?"&#xD;
"Would you like Dromy Tuck, Miss Faith ?-but I don't&#xD;
~ know that you ever saw him. He's strong, and honest-.&#xD;
~ he's not very bright. I'll find somebody." And so th~&#xD;
matter ended.&#xD;
August went on,-.--Reuben sawed his last stick of wood&#xD;
and eat his last breakfast at Mrs. Derrick's, and then set&#xD;
forth for Quilipeak, to begin his new life there. The little&#xD;
settlement at Quapaw was not alone in feeling his loss,-&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick and Faith missed him every day. One of Reu~&#xD;
ben's last doings in Pattaquasset, was the giving Dromy&#xD;
in charge to Phil Davids.&#xD;
"Look after him a little, Phil," he said, "and see that&#xD;
' he don't go to sleep too much daytimes. He means to go&#xD;
~ straight, but he wants help about it; and I don't want&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick to be bothered with him." Which request, en~&#xD;
forced as it was by private considerations, favoured Dromy&#xD;
with as strict a censorship as he desired.&#xD;
Fron~, Germany news came at last,-but it was of the&#xD;
sort tha~t one can bear to wait for. Mrs. Iredell was not&#xD;
able to be moved nor certain to get well. Mr. Linden&#xD;
could neither come with his sister nor from her. And thus,&#xD;
hindered *from getting home to his Seminary duties in&#xD;
America, there was but one thing he could do-finish his&#xD;
course in a German University. But that ensured his&#xD;
being in Europe the whole year.! No question now of fall&#xD;

or winter or spring,-.-summer was the first time that could&#xD;
be even thought of; and in this fair September, when Faith&#xD;
had been thinking of the possibility of his sudden appear.&#xD;
ance, he was beginning his work anew in a foreign land.&#xD;
* It came heavily at first upon her. Faith had not knowa&#xD;
how much she counted on that hope or possibility. But&#xD;
now when it was gone she found she had lost a large piece&#xD;
of her sunlight. She had read her letter alone, as usual,&#xD;
and alone she struggled with her sorrow. It cost Faith&#xD;
for once a great many tears. Prayer was always her&#xD;
refuge. Bat at last after the tears and the signs of them&#xD;
were gone, Faith went into her mother's company again,&#xD;
looking wistful and as gentle and quiet.&#xD;
Perhaps it was well for Faith that her mother knew what&#xD;
this quiet meant-it saved her countless little remarks of&#xD;
wonder and comnXent and sorrow. More devoted to her Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick could not be, but she had her own strong box of&#xD;
feeling, and there locked up all her sorrow and anxiety out&#xD;
of sight. Yet it was some time before the little sitting-&#xD;
room, with its scattered bits of work, could look bright&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"And I sha'n't see him again till-.-.~." It save Faith&#xD;
a great pang. That "next year" she never looked at&#xD;
much. She would have liked a little more of those inno-&#xD;
cent play days which had been so unexpectedly broken oft'.&#xD;
"Next year". looked serious, as well as glad. "But it i~&#xD;
good for me," she said to herself. "It must be good for&#xD;
me, to be reminded to live on what cannot fail. I suppose&#xD;
I was getting to be too very happy. ".-And after a few&#xD;
such talks with herself Faith went straight on, for all that&#xD;
appeared, as peacefully as ever, and as cheerfully.&#xD;
It was not long after this, that passing Mr. Simlins' gate&#xD;
one afternoon, as she was coming home from a walk, Faith&#xD;
was hailed by the farmer. She could not but stop to speak&#xD;
to him, and then she could not prevent his carrying her off&#xD;
into the house.&#xD;
"'Twont hurt you to rest a minute-and 'twont hurt&#xD;
n~" said he. "Why I haint seen you since Howe&#xD;
long do you s'pose folks can live and not see moonshine?&#xD;
Now you pull off your bonnet, and I'll tell Mrs. Hummins&#xD;
to give us something good for tea."&#xD;
&#xD;

"WIu~t would mother do for hers, Mr. Simlins ?" said&#xD;
Faith resisting this invitation.&#xD;
"Well you can sit down anyhow, and read to me," said&#xD;
Mr. Simlins, who had already taken .a seat himself in pre-&#xD;
paration for it. "People can't get along without light from&#xD;
one phenomenon or the other, you know, Faith."&#xD;
She took off her bonnet, and brought the Bible. "What&#xD;
do you want, Mr. Simlins ?" her sweet voice said ~&#xD;
ingly.&#xD;
"Fact is," said the farmer rather sorrowfully,. "I s'pose&#xD;
I want about everything! I don't feel to know much&#xD;
more 'n a baby-and there aint more'n three grains of corn&#xD;
to the bushel in our minister's preachin'. I go to meeting'&#xD;
and come home with my head a little more like a bell than&#xD;
'twas; for there's nothing more in it but a ringin' of the&#xD;
words I've heerd. Do you mind, Faith, when somebody-&#xD;
I don't know whether you or II like him best-wanted me&#xD;
to try a new kind of. farming ?-you mind it? I guess you&#xD;
do. It never went out o' my head again, till I set out to&#xD;
try;-and now I find I don't know nothing' at all how to&#xD;
work it 1"&#xD;
"What is the trouble, dear Mr. Simlins ?" said Faith&#xD;
looking up.&#xD;
The farmer hesitated, then said low and huskily, "I don't&#xD;
know what to do about joining' the church."&#xD;
"The Bible says, 'If a man love God, the same is known&#xD;
of him,' "-Faith answered softly.&#xD;
"Well, but can't it be known of him without that? Fact&#xD;
is, Faith, I'm afeard t"-.-and a rough hand was drawn across&#xD;
the farmer's eyes-" I'm afeard, if I do, I'll do something I&#xD;
hadn't ought to do, and so only just dishonour the profes.&#xD;
sion-and I'd better not have anything to do with it 1"&#xD;
Faith turned back the leaves of the Bible.&#xD;
"Listen to what God said to Joshua, Mr. Simlins, when&#xD;
he was going to lead the people of Israel over into a land&#xD;
full of enemies.-&#xD;
"'Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a&#xD;
good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed."'&#xD;
"It's easy to say 'be strong '," said the farmer after&#xD;
pausing a minute,.-"but how are you going to contrive&#xD;
it?"&#xD;

Faith read from the Psalms; and her words fell sweeter&#xD;
every one. "'In the day when I cried thou answeredst me,&#xD;
and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.' Thati3&#xD;
what David says, Mr. Simlins; and this is Isaiah's testi.&#xD;
mony~-' They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their&#xD;
strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they&#xD;
shall run and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not&#xD;
faint.'"&#xD;
"Go ahead, Faith !"-said the farmer, who was sitting with&#xD;
his head down in his hands. "You aint leaving' me much of&#xD;
a corner to hide in. Turn down a leaf at them places."&#xD;
Faith was still again, turning over leaves.&#xD;
"Paul was in trouble once, Mr. Simlins, and prayed ear.&#xD;
nestly about something; and this is what he says of the&#xD;
Lord's answer to him..-.-'And he said unto me, My grace is&#xD;
sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weak~&#xD;
ness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my in.&#xD;
firmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.'-.-.&#xD;
When I am weak, then am I strong.' And in an other&#xD;
place.-' I can do all things through Ghrist which strength.&#xD;
eneth me.'"&#xD;
"But he wasn't much like me," said Mr. Simlins-J'he&#xD;
was an apostle audhad inspiration. I hadn't none."&#xD;
"'He was a man, though," said Faith, "and a weak one, as&#xD;
you see h' calls himself. And he prays for the Christians&#xD;
at Ephesus, that God would grant them 'to be strengthened&#xD;
with might by his Spirit;' and they were common people.&#xD;
And the Bible says 'Be strong in the Lord and in the power&#xD;
of his might ;'-.we aren't bid to be strong in ourselves; hut&#xD;
here again, 'Strengthened with might, according to his glo-&#xD;
rious power, unto all patience and long-suffering with joy-&#xD;
fulness.' Won't that do ?" said Faith softly.&#xD;
"Have you put marks in all them places ?" said the farmer.&#xD;
"I will."&#xD;
"If that don't do, I s'pose nothing will," said Mr. Sim.&#xD;
lins. "They're mighty words! And they've stopped my&#xD;
mouth."&#xD;
Faith wa~ silently marking the places. The farmer sat&#xD;
looking at her.&#xD;
"You do know the Scriptures..-4 can say that for you !"&#xD;
he remarked.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, Mr. Simlins !-.--" said Faith looking up suddenly,-..&#xD;
"I don't know this string of passages of myself.' Mr. Lin~&#xD;
den showed them to me," she said more softly and blushing.&#xD;
She went on with what she was about.-~&#xD;
"Well don't he say you like to speak truth rather than&#xD;
anything else ?" said the farmer. "If he don't, I wouldn't&#xD;
give much for his discretion. When's he going to have&#xD;
leave to take you away, Faith ?" It was half sorrowfully&#xD;
spoken, and though Faith rose up and blushed, she did not&#xD;
answer him quickly.&#xD;
"My business must take me away now, sir ;.-good niglit."&#xD;
But Mr. Simlins shouted to Jem Waters, had the wagon&#xD;
up, put Faith in with infinite care and tenderness, and sent&#xD;
her home so.&#xD;
One rainy, stormy, wild equinoctial day in the end of Sep-&#xD;
tember-not long after that letter had come, Squire Stout-&#xD;
enburgh came to the door. Faith heard him paricying with&#xD;
her mother for a minute-heard him go off, and then Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick entered the sitting-room, with her eyes full of tear3&#xD;
and her heart, at least, full of a little package,-~-it did not&#xD;
quite fill her hands.&#xD;
"Pretty child !" she said, "I'm so thankful !"-and she&#xD;
went straight off to the kitchen, and the little package lay&#xD;
in Faith's lap. The thick brown paper and wax and twine&#xD;
said it had com'e a long way. The rest the address told.&#xD;
It was a little square box, the opening of which revealed&#xD;
at first only soft cotton; except, in one corner, there was an&#xD;
indication of Faith's infallible blue ribband. Fastened to&#xD;
that, was a gold locket. Quite plain, alike on both sides,&#xD;
the tiny hinge at one edge spoke of a c~rrespondiug spring.&#xD;
That touched, Faith found Mr. Linden. Admirably well&#xD;
done and like, even to the. expression, which had probably&#xD;
struck the artist's fancy; for he had contrived to represent&#xD;
well both the pleasure and the pain Mr. Linden had felt iii&#xD;
sitting for this picture, for such a reason. The dress was&#xD;
that of the German students-such as he was then wearing.&#xD;
Faith had never guessed-till her wondering fingers had&#xD;
persuaded the locket to open-she had never guessed what&#xD;
she should find there; at the utmost she looked to find a&#xD;
lock of l~air; and the joy was almost as overwhelming as a&#xD;
little while ago pain had been. Faith could hardly see the&#xD;

picture for a long time; she called herself foolish, but she&#xD;
cried and laughed the harder for joy; she reproached her.&#xD;
self for past ungratefulness and motions of discontent, which&#xD;
made her not deserve this treasure; and the joy and th~&#xD;
tears were but enhanced that way. Faith could hardly&#xD;
believe her eyes, when they~ were clear enough to see~&#xD;
seem ed,-what they looked at,-too good to be true; ~&#xD;
precious to be hers. But at last she was fain to believe it;&#xD;
aad with blushes that nobody saw, and a tiny smile that i~&#xD;
was a pity somebody didn't see, she put the blue ribband&#xD;
round her neck and hid the locket where she knew it was&#xD;
expected to find its place. But Faith forgot her work, and&#xD;
her mother found her sitting there doing nothing, looking&#xD;
with dreamy happy thoughtfulness into distance, or into&#xD;
herself; all Miss Bezac's silks and stuffs neglected around&#xD;
j her.&#xD;
And work, diligent., happy, contented, continued, was the&#xD;
order of the day, and of many days and weeks after. Miss&#xD;
Bezac giving out that she would take as much work as was&#xD;
~cdfered her, she and Faith soon had both their hands com~&#xD;
pletely full. The taste and skill of the little dressmaker&#xD;
were so well acknowledged that even from Pequot there was&#xD;
now many an application for her services; and many a lady&#xD;
from there and from Pattaquasset, came driven in a wagon&#xD;
or a sleigh to Miss Bezac's cottage door.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
I T was the month&#xD;
"When beechen buds begin to swell,&#xD;
And woods the blue bird's warble know,"-&#xD;
the month of the unbending of Nature -of softening&#xD;
skies and swelling streams and much underground spring&#xD;
work. As $~r instance, by the daffodils; which by some&#xD;
unknown ma~1~inery pushed their soft, pliant haves up&#xD;
through frozen clods into the sunshine. Blue birds flut~&#xD;
tered their ~v~ings and trilled their voices through the air,&#xD;
song sparrows sang from morning to night, and waxwings&#xD;
whistled for cherries in the bare tree tops. There the wind&#xD;
whistled too, "whiles," with the full approbation of snow~&#xD;
birds and chickadees, -the three going out of fashion&#xD;
together.&#xD;
It was a busy month at Miss Bezac's-two weddings at&#xD;
Pequot and one in Pattaquasset kept her hands full,-and&#xD;
Faith's too. Just now the great point of interest was the&#xD;
outfit of Miss Maria Davids-the wedding dress, especially,&#xD;
being of the most complicate and ornamented description.&#xD;
Miss Bezac and Faith needed their heads as well as their&#xD;
hands, Miss Maria's directions with regard to flowers and&#xD;
furbelows being somewhat 4ike the Vicar of Wakefield's in&#xD;
respect of sheep-only Mik Maria was willing to pay for&#xD;
all that went on, whereas the Vicar wanted the sheep for&#xD;
nothing.&#xD;
Thus they stood, the two friends and co-workers, with&#xD;
the dress spread out on a table, contriving where the&#xD;
flowers should go and how many it would be possible to&#xD;
put on. Miss Maria's box of Pequot flowers on a chair.&#xD;
near by, was as full as her directions.&#xD;
"lit would be better to take the box and turn it right&#xD;
over her aft&amp;amp;r she's dressed, and let 'em stick whera they&#xD;
would!" said Miss Bez~tc. in some disgust. Whereupon,&#xD;

&#xD;
dropping her grave look of thought, Faith's laugh broke&#xD;
up the monotony of the occasion.&#xD;
"Well that's good any way," said Miss Bezac. "And&#xD;
I'm sure everything's 'any way' about this dress. But I&#xD;
wont have you ab4 it a bit longer,-youre tired to death&#xD;
standing up."&#xD;
"I'm not much tired. Miss Bezac, let the lilacs have the&#xD;
bottom of the dress, and the roses and lilies of the valley&#xD;
trim the body.-Aud it wilL be like a spotted flower-garden&#xD;
then !" said Faith laughing anew.&#xD;
how little like her occupation she looked,.-with her&#xD;
brown stuff dress, to be sure, as plain as possible; her soft&#xD;
brown hair also plain; her quaint little white ruffles; and&#xD;
that brilliant diamond ring flashing wherever her hand&#xD;
went! N.B. A plain dress on a pretty person has not the&#xD;
effect of plainness, since it lets that better be seen which i~&#xD;
the highest beauty.&#xD;
Up Miss I3czac's mountain road came a green coach&#xD;
drawn by two fat grey horses; the coachman in front and&#xD;
the f6otman behind being in the same state of plethoric&#xD;
comfort. They addressed themselves to the hill with no&#xD;
hasty approbation yet with much mind to have their own&#xD;
way, and the hill yielded the ground step by step. At Miss&#xD;
Bezac's door hill and horses made a pause.&#xD;
"Coaches already !" said Miss Bezac,-.-" that's a sign of&#xD;
summer, as good as wild geese. And you'd think, Faith,&#xD;
not having had much experience, that it was the sign of&#xD;
another wedding dress-hut nothing worse than a calico&#xD;
wrapper ever comes out of a coach like that."&#xD;
"Why ?"-said Faith looking amused.&#xD;
"The people that drive such coaches drive 'em to town&#xD;
for a wedding dress," said Miss Bezac sagely. "There's a&#xD;
blue bi~d~ getting out of this one, to begin with."&#xD;
While she spoke, a tiny foot emerged from the coach,&#xD;
and after it a dress of blue silk, which so far from "stand-&#xD;
ing alone" folloWed softly every motion of the wearer. A&#xD;
simply plain shirred spring bonnet of blue ~.nd white silk,&#xD;
made the blue bird comparison not altogether unapt,-the&#xD;
bird was hardly more fair and dainty in his way than the&#xD;
lady in hers. She stood still for a minute, shading her&#xD;
eyes with her hand, and looking off down the road.; t~&#xD;
&#xD;
slight, delicate figure, with that sort of airy grace which&#xD;
has a natural poise for every position,.-.then she turned&#xD;
uptly and knocked at the door.&#xD;
Now it was Miss Bezac 's custom to let applicants open&#xD;
and shut for themselves, her hands being often at ~a critical&#xD;
point of work; so in this case, with a refractory flower&#xD;
half adjusted-while Faith was in the intricacies of a knot&#xD;
of ribband, she merely cried, "Come in !" And the young&#xD;
lady came-so far as across the threshold,-there she&#xD;
~ stopped. A quick, sudden stop,-one little ungloved hand&#xD;
that looked as if it had never touched anything harsher&#xD;
than satin? clasped close upon its gloved companion; the&#xD;
~ shawl falling from her shoulders and showing the bunch of&#xD;
~ crocuses in her belt; the fair, sweet, high bred face-spark-&#xD;
~ hug, withal flushing like a June rose. For a minute she&#xD;
stood, her bright eyes seeing the room, the work, and Miss&#xD;
+ Bezac, but resting on Faith with a sort of intenseness of&#xD;
look that went from face to hand. Then her own eyes fell,&#xD;
and with a courteous inclination of her head, she came for-&#xD;
ward and spoke.&#xD;
"I was told," she said, advancing slowly to the table, and&#xD;
 still with downcast eyes,-" I was told that-I mean-Can&#xD;
you make a sunbonnet for me, Miss Bezac ?" She looked&#xD;
up then, but only at the little dressmaker, laying one hand&#xD;
on the table as if to support herself; and with a face grave&#xD;
enough to suit a nun's veil instead of a sunbonnet.&#xD;
Faith's eyes were held on this delicate little figure with a.&#xD;
sort of charm; she was very unlike the Pattaquasset models.&#xD;
At the antipodes from Miss Essie De Staff-etherial com.&#xD;
pared to the more solid proprieties of Sophy Harrison,-&#xD;
Faith recognized in her the type of another class of crea-&#xD;
tures. She drew back a little from the table, partly to&#xD;
leave the field clear to Miss Bezac, partly tG please herself&#xD;
with a better view.&#xD;
"A sunbonnet ?" Miss Bezac repeated,-" I should be&#xD;
sorry if I couldn't, and badly off too- But I'm afraid you'll&#xD;
be? for a pattern,-all I've got a-re as common as grass.&#xD;
Not that I wish grass was uncommon, either-but what's&#xD;
the stuff?"&#xD;
When I came out this morning," said the lady, glancing&#xD;
at Faith and then down- again, "I did not expect to come&#xD;
&#xD;

one down to the village ?-4his young lady, perhaps.-..May&#xD;
I take her with me now&#xD;
"Why of ~course you may !" said Miss Bezac delightedly.&#xD;
-" Just as much as if I was glad to get rid of her-.-.which&#xD;
I aint,-and am too,-for she's tired to death, and I was&#xD;
just wishing somebody that wasn't would take her home,&#xD;
Or some horses."&#xD;
There was a sweet amused play of the lips in answer to&#xD;
this lucid statement of facts, and then turning towards&#xD;
Faith, the stranger said, "Will you go ?"-the words were&#xD;
in the lowest of sweet tones.&#xD;
"Where do you wish me to go ?" said Faith, coming a&#xD;
step forward.&#xD;
"With me-down into the village."&#xD;
"I will 'go," said Faith. "Then I x~~ill take these two&#xD;
mantillas, Miss Bezac,-and you shall have them the day&#xD;
after to-morrow."&#xD;
The straw bonnet and shawl were put on in another&#xD;
minute, and not waiting for her gloves she followed the&#xD;
"blue bird" to the carriage, rather pleased with the adven-&#xD;
ture.&#xD;
The little ungloved hand took firm hold of hers as they&#xD;
stepped out of Miss Bezac's door, and but that the idea&#xD;
was absurd Faith would have thought it was trembling.&#xD;
Once in the carriage, the two ship by side on the soft&#xD;
cushions, the orders given to the footman, the coach rolling&#xD;
smoothly down the hill, the stranger turned her eyes fulL&#xD;
upon Faith; until the tears came too fast, quenching the&#xD;
quivering smile on her lips. Her head dropped on Faith's&#xD;
shoulder, with a little cry of:, "Faith, do you know who&#xD;
I am&#xD;
A sort of whirlwind of thoughts swept over Faith-&#xD;
nothing definite; and her answer was a doubtful, rather&#xD;
troubled, "No."-.&#xD;
"I know who you are !" said the stranger. "You are&#xD;
Mignonette."&#xD;
"Who told you so ?" said Faith, drawing back from her&#xD;
to look.&#xD;
"Some one who knew !"-the face was lovely in its .A~pril&#xD;
of mischief and tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
Faith's face grew very grave, with doubt, and bewilder-&#xD;
ment, and growing certainty, and drew yet further off.&#xD;
Rosy blushes, more and more witchingly shy, chased in and&#xD;
out of her cheeks; till obeying the certainty which yet was&#xD;
vague, Faith's head stooped, and her two hands covered&#xD;
her face. She was drawn back into the stranger's arms, and&#xD;
her hands and face (what there could) were covered with&#xD;
kisses.&#xD;
"Faith, is it strange your sister should know ?-and why&#xD;
don't you let me have the rest of your face to kiss ?-J&#xD;
haven't half seen it yet. And I'm sure' Endy would' not&#xD;
like to have his message delivered in these out of the way&#xD;
places."&#xD;
Even as she spoke, the hands quitted the face, veiled only'&#xD;
by the rosiest consciousness; and laying both hands on the&#xD;
stranger Faith gave her warm kisses-on cheeks and lips;&#xD;
and then looked at her, with eyes alternately eager and shy,&#xD;
that rose and fell at every new stir of feeling.&#xD;
"How did you come here ?".-she said with a sort of&#xD;
soft breathlessness. The eyes that looked at her were as*&#xD;
intent, a little laughing, a little moved.&#xD;
"How did I come here ?-Faith, I knew you at the first&#xD;
glance,-how came you not to know me,?"&#xD;
"I-could not 1" said Faith. "How came you here ?"&#xD;
"Here? in Pattaquasset-how I love the name! Faith,&#xD;
I shall expect you to take me to every place where Ende~&#xD;
cott set his foot when he was here."&#xD;
Faith's eye gave a little answering flash. "I don't be~&#xD;
lieve I know them all. Then-" she checked herself-&#xD;
"But how did you come here? Y'ou-were in Germany."&#xD;
"Then what ?-please answer me first."&#xD;
How Faith blushed !-.and laughed; but she grew very&#xD;
grave almost immediately.&#xD;
"Please answer me 1" she said.&#xD;
"Yes, I was there-and I could not help coming here,"&#xD;
Miss Linden answered.  "To leave him there, after all!&#xD;
But I could not help it, Faith.  When he determined to&#xD;
spend the year thei'e-.-and Ii never saw him look so grave&#xD;
over a determination-it was for one reason alone. You&#xD;
know what ?"&#xD;

* Faith did not assent nor dissent, but her eyes&#xD;
lowing every word.                         were swa!.&#xD;
"It seemed then as if it might not much lengthen hi8&#xD;
absence, and would ensure its being the last. And by-the.&#xD;
by, fair ladye, Endecott said I might make the most of yo~&#xD;
before he got home; for theh he meant to have you all to&#xD;
himself for six months, and nobody else should have a~sight&#xD;
of you."&#xD;
As far as they could go, Faith's eyes fell; and h~r new&#xD;
sister might study the fair face and figure she had not had&#xD;
so good an opportunity of studying before. Perfectly&#xD;
grave, and still to her folded hands.,&#xD;
"After he was fairly launched in his work," Miss Linden&#xD;
went on, "Aunt Iredell began slowly to grow better; and&#xD;
as the Winter passed she took the most earnest desire to&#xD;
come home-to America. Nothing could shake it; and&#xD;
the doctors approved and urged that there should be no&#xD;
delay. Then, Faith, I would have stayed,..-..but she was&#xD;
exceedingly dependent upon me, and most of all, Endecott&#xD;
said I ought to come. I believe he was glad to think of&#xD;
my being here for another reason. He came with us to&#xD;
/ Paris-it happened just then that he could come-and put&#xD;
us on boardthe steamer. But we were three days in Paris&#xD;
first,-O such pretty days !" she added smiling. "I'll tell&#xD;
you about them another time."&#xD;
The downcast eyes were lifted and rested for a minute on&#xD;
the sparkling face before them. If a little warm light in&#xD;
their glance meant that all ~as "pretty" about which those&#xD;
two had to do, it said part at least of what was in Faith's&#xD;
mind.&#xD;
"Now I am to be your neighbour for a while," said Miss&#xD;
Linden. "Aunt Iredell was ordered out of town at once,&#xD;
and last night we came up to Pequot,.-..-so you must not&#xD;
wonder if you see me every other day after this. 0 how&#xD;
good it is to see you! Do you know," she said, wrapping&#xD;
her arms round Faith again, and resting the soft cheeks&#xD;
and lips upon hers, "do you know how much I have to say&#xD;
of this sort, for somebody else ?"&#xD;
"You are not going back to Pequot to-day ?" said Faith&#xD;
softly.,&#xD;
"May I stay in Pattaquasset till to-morrow ?"&#xD;

* "If I can take good enough care of you 1" said Faith,&#xD;
kissing her half gladly, half timidly.&#xD;
"And may I go home with you now?"&#xD;
"Where are we going ?" said Faith looking out.&#xD;
My dear, you ought to know! but I do not. I told&#xD;
them to drive about till I gave contrary orders. Now you&#xD;
must give them." And the check string brought the horses&#xD;
to a stand and the footman ditto. A half minute's observa.~&#xD;
tion enabled Faith to give directions for reaching the main&#xD;
Pattaquasset road and taking the right turn, and the car-&#xD;
ritwe rolled on again. There was a little pause then, till&#xD;
Faith broke it. A rich preparatory colour rose in her&#xD;
cheeks, and the subject of her words would certainly have&#xD;
laughed to see how gravely, with what commonplace de..&#xD;
inureness, the question was put.&#xD;
"Was Mr. Linden well, when you came from Ger~&#xD;
many ?"&#xD;
"Faith !" was his sister's prompt reply. Faith's glance;&#xD;
soft and blushing, yet demanded reason. Whereupon Miss&#xD;
Linden's face went into a depth of demureness that was&#xD;
wonderful. "Yes my dear, Mr. Linden was well-looking&#xD;
well too, which is an uncommon thing with him."&#xD;
"Is it ?".-said Faith somewhat wistfully.&#xD;
"' Not in the way I mean," said her new sister smiling,-&#xD;
"I thought nothing could have improved his appearance&#xD;
but-Miguonette. And I suppose he thought so himself,&#xD;
for he was never seen without a sprig of the little flowers."&#xD;
Faith's look in answer to that was given to nothing but&#xD;
the ground, and indeed it was worthy to have been seen by&#xD;
only one person.&#xD;
"Faith," said Miss Linden suddenly, "are there many&#xD;
French people in Pattaquasset ?"&#xD;
"No,---not any. Why?"&#xD;
"Because Endecott gave me a message to y ~u, part ot&#xD;
which I did not understand. But I suppose yo~i will, and&#xD;
that is enough."&#xD;
,"What is it ?" said Faith eagerly.&#xD;
"You would not understand the other part, to-day."&#xD;
Faith went back to her thoughtfulness But as the car-&#xD;
riage turned into the Pattaquasset high street she suddenly&#xD;
faced round on Miss Linden, flushing again before she spoke.&#xD;

"Pet," she said a little timidly.-it was winning, this air&#xD;
of timidity that was about her,-" don't say-don't tell ~1r,&#xD;
Linden where you found me."&#xD;
"Faidi! does he not know? is it something new? 0&#xD;
dear child, I am very sorry !"-and Miss Linden's other&#xD;
hand came caressingly upon (he one she held.&#xD;
"Don't be sorry !~2' said Faith, looking as fearless and&#xD;
sonsy as any real piece of mignonette that ever shook its&#xD;
brown head in the wind;-" I wouldn't tell you, only you&#xD;
must see it. You know, perhaps, that mother lived by a&#xD;
farm.-Last summer the farm was taken away and we had&#xD;
nothing left but the house. We had to do something, and&#xD;
I took to dressmaking with Miss Bezac-where you found&#xD;
me. And it has been very pleasant and has done very well,"&#xD;
said Faith, smiling at Miss Linden as honestly as if the&#xD;
matter had been of music lessons or any other accomplish.&#xD;
meut. Miss Linden looked at her-grave and bright too.&#xD;
Then with a sparkle of her eyes-" I won't tell Endecott&#xD;
now, but some time I will tell him over what sort of a wed-&#xD;
ding-dress I found you poring. But 'my dear child !-"&#xD;
and she stopped with a look of sudden thought that was&#xD;
both grave and gay. Faith's eyes asked what the matter&#xD;
was.&#xD;
~         not tell him now," Miss Linden repeated,-&#xD;
while-.--he could not know it in; time for any.&#xD;
thing but his own sorrow. But Faith! I am doing to make&#xD;
one of those mantillas !"-and she looked a pretty piece of&#xD;
defiant resolution.&#xD;
"You shall do what you please," Faith said gayly. "But&#xD;
-will you stop them ?-there is the house."&#xD;
The coach came to a stand before Mrs. Derrh~k's little&#xD;
gate and the two ladies alighted. Miss Linden had been&#xD;
looking eagerly out as they drove up-at the house, the&#xD;
fence, the little garden courtyard, the steps,-but she turned&#xD;
now to give her orders, and taking Faith's hand again, fol-&#xD;
lowed her in, looking at every inch of the way. Faith&#xD;
drew the easy-chair out before the fire, put Miss Linden in&#xD;
it, and took off her bonnet and shawl. She staid but to&#xD;
find her mother and introduce her to the parlour and her&#xD;
guest; and she herself ran away to Mr. Linden's room.&#xD;
She knew that the brown woodbox was near full of wood&#xD;
&#xD;
~h1~h had been there since his sudden departure nine months&#xD;
ago. It was wel dried by this time. Faith built a fire&#xD;
and kindled it, made the bed, and supplied water and tow-&#xD;
els; opened the blinds of one or two windows, laid books&#xD;
on the table, and wheeled up the couch. The fire was blaz-&#xD;
ing by that time and shone warm and glowingly on the&#xD;
dark wood and furniture, and everything wore the oI~.pleas-&#xD;
ant look of comfort and prettiness. Then Faith went for&#xD;
her guest.&#xD;
"You will know where you are," she said a 1~itt1e vaguely,&#xD;
-" when you open the cupboard doors."&#xD;
Miss Linden stood still for a moment, her hands folded,&#xD;
her lips again taking their mixed expression.&#xD;
"And that is where he lay for so long," she said. It&#xD;
was a mixed remembrance to Faith; she did ng t like to&#xD;
answer. A moment's silence, and she turned her bright&#xD;
face to Miss Linden.&#xD;
"Let me do what I can for you," she said with that mix-&#xD;
ture of grace and timidity.-." It isn't much. What may I&#xD;
now, Pet?"&#xD;
"You did a lifetime's 'work then, you dear child !..-.and&#xD;
how I used to hear of it." And putting her arm round&#xD;
Faith's waist Miss Linden began to go slowly about the&#xD;
room, looking at everything-out of the windows and into&#xD;
the cupboards. "If you could have known, Faith-if you&#xD;
could have seen Endecott in some of the years before that,&#xD;
you would hay.~ known a little how very, very glad I was.&#xD;
I hardly believed that he would ever find any one who could&#xD;
charm him out of the solitary life into which sorrow had&#xD;
led him."&#xD;
"I didn't do it !" said Faith simply.&#xD;
"What do you suppose did ?"&#xD;
"I think he charmed himself out of it~"-Faith said&#xD;
blushing.&#xD;
Miss Lind~~n laughed, holding her very fast. "You are&#xD;
clear from all~harge of malice prepense," she said. "And I&#xD;
will not deny his powers of charming,-but they are power-&#xD;
less upon himself."&#xD;
"Do you think so ?" said Faith. "A charm comes at&#xD;
the rebound, doesn't it sometimes ?"&#xD;
"Does it? How do I know ?"&#xD;
&#xD;

Faith laughed a little, but very softly. "Now shall ~&#xD;
leave you for a little while ?" she said.&#xD;
"Will you be busy, or may I come down when I like ?"&#xD;
"I am going into the kitchen,-You wouldn't like to&#xD;
follow me there ?"&#xD;
"If I have leave-I am in the mind to follow you every.&#xD;
where."&#xD;
"Come then t" said Faith joyously.&#xD;
Miss Linden might not be accustomed to seeing kitchens,&#xD;
or she might! there was no telling from her manner. Cer~&#xD;
tainly that kitchen was a pleasant one to see. And she 'fob.&#xD;
lowed,' as she had said, wherever Faith went and watched&#xD;
~ her whatever she did, conversation going on meanwhile amus-&#xD;
ingly enough. Faith was making some cakes again; and&#xD;
then concocting coffee, the Pattaquasset f~~te dish in ordi-&#xD;
nary; while Mrs. Derrick broiled the chicken. With a great&#xD;
white apron enveloping her brown stuff dress, and her arms&#xD;
bared, running about the kitchen and dairy in her quick still&#xD;
way, Faith was a pretty contrast to the 'blue bird' who&#xD;
~miled on her and followed hey and talked to her throughout.&#xD;
Then the cakes were baking, and Faith came back to the&#xD;
sitting-room; to set the table and cover it with all dainty&#xD;
things that farm materials cab produce.. And if ever 'Pet'&#xD;
had been affectionately served, she was that night, and if&#xD;
ever a room was fresh and sweet and warm and glowing, the&#xD;
fire-lit room where she went to sleep afterwards was such a,&#xD;
one.&#xD;
But before that, when they had done tea, and talk and&#xD;
motion had subsided a little, Miss Linden brought a low&#xD;
seat to Faith's side, anq taking that left hand in hers looked&#xD;
silently at the ring for a few minutes,-then laid her cheek&#xD;
down upon it in Faith's lap. Faith's lip trembled; but she&#xD;
only sat still as a statue till the cheek was lifted up.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
I N the early morning which Faith and her mother enjoyed&#xD;
next day together, Mrs. ~Derrick was in a contemplative&#xD;
nnd abstracted state of mind; assenting indeed to all Faith's&#xD;
words of pleasure and praise, but evidently thinking of&#xD;
something else. At last the matter came out.&#xD;
"Faith, how much money have we ?~-I mean, to last&#xD;
how long, suppose you didn't do anything else but the&#xD;
butter ?"&#xD;
"Why, mother ?"&#xD;
"Why child, I've been thinking-do ~y ou know how much&#xD;
you've got to do for yourself ?-.it woii~ t do to put that off&#xD;
for Miss Bezac."&#xD;
Faith's lips softly touched Mrs. Derrick's.&#xD;
"Hush, mother, please !-Don't you think Dromy could&#xD;
find some water-cress at the foot of the Savin hill?"&#xD;
"Yes - like enough," said Mrs. Derrick, - "Reuben&#xD;
could if he was here. And child, you may say 'hush,' but&#xD;
things won't hush, after all." With which sentiment Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick gave attention to the tea-kettle, just then a p~acti~&#xD;
cal illustration of h~r remark.&#xD;
About as bright and fresh and sweet as the morning Miss&#xD;
Linden looked when she came down, but warmer and gentler&#xD;
than March in his b.est mood. Her interest in everythfrig'&#xD;
about the house and its two tenants was unbounded, and&#xD;
without being really like her brother, there was enough&#xD;
family likeness in manner and voice to give a pleasant&#xD;
reminder iiow and then. While they were at l~reakfast the&#xD;
man came from Pequot according to order, but sl~e went&#xD;
out alone to attend to him, coming back to the table with a&#xD;
sort of gleeful face that spoke of pleasure or mischief in&#xD;
prospect.&#xD;
"Faith," she said, "we cannot touch those mantillas this&#xD;
morning."&#xD;
"Can't we ?" said Faith. "Which part of Pattaquasset&#xD;
shall we go to seer"(883)&#xD;

&#xD;
"Suppose we go up to my room and discuss matters."..~&#xD;
Faith was ready. Ready as a child, or as the "bird"&#xD;
she used to be called, for any innocent play or work.&#xD;
"My dear little sister," said Miss Linden as they ran up&#xD;
stairs, the glee working out at the dainty finger ends that&#xD;
were on Faith's belt, "don't you know that J promised y~&#xD;
a 'message'? and don't you want to have it ?.-.O how&#xD;
lovely this room is! That trunk is not lovely, standing&#xD;
just there. Dear Faith, you need not think all my bag.&#xD;
gage is coming after it I"&#xD;
"I wish it could,"-...said Faith, looking after her 'mes.&#xD;
sage.'&#xD;
"I want to shew you the key of this-it has something&#xD;
peculiar about it," said Miss Linden searching in her bag~&#xD;
"Endecott said, Faith, that as you and he had been to.&#xD;
gather so much in a French atmosphere, you must let him&#xD;
do one thing in the French style. Td' which message~ as&#xD;
well as to the trunk, you will find this the key."&#xD;
Now attached to the key was a little card, on which was&#xD;
written simply the word, "Trousseau."&#xD;
Faith understood the word well enough, and it seemed&#xD;
to turn her into a pretty petrifaction-..-..with internal life at&#xD;
work indeed, as the rising and falling colours witnessed.&#xD;
She stood with bended. head looking at the mysterious&#xD;
key; then making a swift transit to the window she opened&#xD;
it and threw back the blinds and stood looking out, the key&#xD;
in one hand giving little impatient or abstracted taps&#xD;
against the fingers of the other. It was a pretty landscape&#xD;
certainly, but Faith had looked at it often before.&#xD;
Miss Linden on her part followed Faith to the window&#xD;
with her eyes and a smile, then sat looking' at the great&#xD;
leather trunk in its travelling cover, which it wore sf11.&#xD;
Once she made a motion to take this off-.--then ~ r&#xD;
hands back in their former position and waited f6r&#xD;
come.&#xD;
"Pet," said Faith presently,.....-." have you looked out of&#xD;
the window this morning ?" Which question brought two&#xD;
hands round her shoulders in no time.&#xD;
"Yes my dear, I have. What new be uties have you&#xD;
discovered ?"&#xD;
"It looks pretty in the spring light.-.-But I wasn't. think.&#xD;
&#xD;
ing of it, either," said Faith blushing. And without rais~&#xD;
ing her eyes, looking distressed, she softly insinuated the&#xD;
key with its talismanic card back into Miss Linden's hand.&#xD;
"Well? what, dear Faith ?"&#xD;
"I don't know,".-said Faith softly. "You know."&#xD;
"I know, ".-.-said Miss Linden, "that Endecott locked&#xD;
the trunk and tied the label to the key, and it is a great&#xD;
mistake to suppose that I will unlock the one or take&#xD;
charge of the other. In the second place, I need not even&#xD;
look on unless you wish. It can go to another room, or I&#xD;
will leave you in undisturbed' possession of this. So speak,"&#xD;
she said, kissing her.&#xD;
Faith did not immediately. She wound her arms round&#xD;
her new sister and hid her face in Miss Linden's neck, and&#xD;
stood so clasping her silently for a few minutes. But when&#xD;
she raised her head she went straight to the "trousseau"&#xD;
trunk; pulled off, business fashion, the travelling cover;&#xD;
set the key in the lock, and lifted the lid.&#xD;
"I should tell iou, dear," said Miss Linden while this&#xD;
was doing-she had seated herself a little way off from&#xD;
Faith and the trunk, "I should tell you, that if it had been&#xD;
possible to get a pattern dress and so forth, you would have&#xD;
found nothing here to do but look. As it is, there is some&#xD;
work for your fingers, and I hope for mine." The lid was&#xD;
now open, and between the two next protecting covers lay&#xD;
a letter. A. recognizing flash of eye greeted that; Faith&#xD;
put it out of sight and lifted the second cover. From&#xD;
where she sat Miss Linden could see her hand tremble.&#xD;
There were two or three characteristics that applied to&#xD;
the whole arrangement, choice, and filling of the "trous-&#xD;
seau." The absence of things useless was not more notable&#xD;
than ~jie~ abundance of things useful; and let not useful be&#xD;
und~Y~od to mean needful,.-.--for of the little extras which&#xD;
are so specially pleasant to those who never buy them for&#xD;
themselves, there was also a full supply. The daintiness&#xD;
of everything was great, but nothing was out of Faith's&#xD;
line: the stuffs might be finer than she had always worn,&#xD;
but the colours were what she had always liked, and in any&#xD;
one of those many dresses she might feel at home in five&#xD;
minutes-they suited her so xvell. She 'could see, well.&#xD;
enough, that Mr. Linden not only remembered "her style"&#xD;

&#xD;
but loved it,-.--in the very top rack, that was first laid open,&#xD;
she had proof of this-for besides the finest of lawn and&#xD;
cambric, there were dainty bands of embroidery and pieces&#xD;
of lace with which Faith could ruffle herself to her hea~'t's&#xD;
content.&#xD;
At this point Faith drew a rather quick breath. She&#xD;
was on her knees before the trunk, and shielding her face a&#xD;
little from Miss Linden, she sat looking in-steadfastly.---at&#xD;
bits of French needlework and lapping of the daintier&#xD;
texture, lifting now and then, also daintily-the end or fold&#xD;
of something to see what lay underneath. There was so&#xD;
much food for meditation, as well as for industry, in this&#xD;
department, that Faith seemed not likely to get through it.&#xD;
How clearly she saw any one thing might be doubted.&#xD;
She made no progress.&#xD;
"You may see Endecott in everything, Faith," said Miss&#xD;
Linden. "In the matter 6f quantity I could sometimes&#xD;
give him help, but every colour and style had to be mafehed&#xD;
with the particular pattern in his mind. I wish you conld&#xD;
have seen it !-it was one of the prettiest things I ever&#xD;
saw. Those three days in Paris !-I told you they were&#xD;
pretty days."&#xD;
Faith gave her a swift look, very flushed and very&#xD;
grave. A pretty picture of wonder and humility she&#xD;
was; and something more was borne witness to by&#xD;
those soft eyes, but Miss Linden had only a second's&#xD;
look of them.&#xD;
The racks seemed to hold the light varieties, each done&#xD;
up by itself. There was the little French parasol in its&#xD;
'box; the fan box, with most pretty contents. There was&#xD;
the glove box, beautifully filled, and holding among the&#xD;
rest the prettiest of riding gauntlets-all of just the right&#xD;
size, by some means. At the other end to keep this in&#xD;
countenance, was a little French riding hat in its own&#xD;
pasteboard container. The riding whip Mr. Linden had&#xD;
given her long before. There were stockings in pretty&#xD;
variety; and handkerchiefs-not laced and. embroidered,&#xD;
kut of fine material and dainty borders. The various&#xD;
minor things were too many to mention.&#xD;
Faith was in an overwhelmed state, though she hardly&#xD;
showed that. Her fingers made acquaintance almost fear~&#xD;
&#xD;
P~lly with the various items that lay in sight; finally sh~&#xD;
laid both hands upon the edge of the rack.&#xD;
"'It is exactly like him !-" she said in profound gravity.&#xD;
Ills sister laughed-a gay, pleased little laugh.&#xD;
"lie said they were all like you, Faith. His fear NOf&#xD;
touching your individuality was comical. Do you know he&#xD;
says he sball expect you always to have a brown merino ?-&#xD;
so you will find one th9re."&#xD;
But first, at the bottom of the rack, under all the others,&#xD;
was the flat mantilla box; and its contents of muslin and&#xD;
silk, in their elegant simpleness, left Miss Bezac's "no-&#xD;
where". How Faith would have liked to shut up the&#xD;
trunk then and run away-nobody knew! For she only&#xD;
quietly lifted out the rack and took the view of what came&#xD;
next. It was not the brown merino !-it was something&#xD;
made up,-the gayest, prettiest, jauntiest dressing gown;&#xD;
with bunches of tiny carnations all over it, as bright as&#xD;
Faith's own. Though that be saying much, for at this hers&#xD;
reached their acme.&#xD;
"How beautiful!-" she said gravely, while her poor&#xD;
fluttering thoughts were saying everything else. "How&#xD;
perfectly beautiful !-"&#xD;
And as delicately as if it had been made of silver tissue,&#xD;
Faith laid it off on the ~ck. Laid it off to find the nest&#xD;
stage in the shape of ni~rning wrappers, also made up.&#xD;
"They fit so loosely at best-" Miss Linden explained,-&#xD;
"and Endecott knew your height."&#xD;
Now neither in these nor in what lay beneath was there&#xD;
such profusion as would furnish a new dress every day (for&#xD;
an indefinite number) at a watering place; but there was&#xD;
just such as befitted a young lady, who being married in&#xD;
summer-days yet looked forward to winter, and was to be&#xD;
the delight of somebody's eyes summer and winter.&#xD;
They were downcast and wonderfully soft eyes that&#xD;
looked at those morning dresses now, - as Miss Linden&#xD;
could see when by chance they were lifted. But that was&#xD;
not generally; with lowered eyelids and unsteady lips Faith&#xD;
went on taking out one after the other. Below, the paek~&#xD;
ages were more solid and compact, some close at both ends,&#xD;
others showing shawl fringes. Dress after dress lay in close&#xD;
order--muslin and silk and stuff; under them pieces of&#xD;

&#xD;
linen and flannel such as Pattaquasset could hardly have&#xD;
furnished. One particular parcel, long and soft, was tied&#xD;
with white ribband. Faith looked at it doubtfully.&#xD;
"Must I open this, Pet ?"&#xD;
"It is tied up for that express purpose."&#xD;
A little suspicious of each new thing, Faith pulled the&#xD;
easy knot of white ribband and uncovered what lay within.&#xD;
It was a white embroidered muslin~ fine and beautiful in its&#xD;
clear texture, as was the wrought tracery upon it. No&#xD;
colour relieved this white field,-a pair of snowy gloves&#xD;
lay upon it, with the lace and sash for its finish of adorn.&#xD;
ment; with them a folded handkerchief; plain like the rest&#xD;
but particularly fine. Separately wrapped up in soft paper&#xD;
that but half hid them, were the little rosette slippers.&#xD;
"He said you must have none but real flowers," Miss&#xD;
Linden said-too softly to call for a look in answer.&#xD;
That dress xvas what not even Miss Bezac had been able&#xD;
to make Faith look at in imagination-and there it lay be-&#xD;
fore her! Perhaps, to tell the truth, she had been hardly&#xD;
willing to realize to herself the future necessity of such a&#xD;
r&#xD;
thing. The blood came deeper to her cheeks, then left&#xD;
them in another moment pale. Faith laid her face in her&#xD;
hands on the edge of the trunk,.-.-.for once overcome.&#xD;
Again Miss Linden's quick impulse was to come to Faith's&#xD;
side, and again she checked herself; thinking perhaps that&#xD;
she was too new a friend to have her words pleasant just&#xD;
then-feeling that there was but one person who could say&#xD;
what ought to be said. So she sat quite still, nor even&#xD;
turned her eyes towards Faith except now and then in a&#xD;
quick glance of sympathy and interest; both which were&#xD;
shewn in her folded hands and averted head. But very&#xD;
sQon Faith was softly doing the parcel up again in its white&#xD;
ribbands; and then she began to lay the things back in the&#xD;
trunk, with quick hands but dainty. half way through,&#xD;
Faith suddenly stopped.&#xD;
"Shall I put these back here for the present ?"-she&#xD;
said, looking towards Miss Linden.&#xD;
"For the present, dear ?-J am not sure that I under-&#xD;
stand."&#xD;
"Just now-till I can arrange some other place to put&#xD;
them."&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                 389&#xD;
"I have nothing to do with 'this place'," said Miss Lin-&#xD;
den smiling,-"it came with my trunks, that is all."&#xD;
Faith coloured again and went on with what she was&#xD;
doing. Miss Linden watched her.&#xD;
".Faith," she said, "don't finish that work just now,-sit&#xD;
still there and read Endy's letter-won't you, darling? II&#xD;
am going down to pay your mother a visit." And with a&#xD;
kiss and embrace she was gone.&#xD;
Faith's hands stopped their work as the door closed, and&#xD;
she sat still, looking at the voiceless messages Qf love, care,&#xD;
thought, and anticipation, which surrounded her. Looking&#xD;
dreamily, *and a little oppressed; and when she moved her&#xD;
hand it was not first to get her letter, but to draw out the&#xD;
locke from her bosom and see Mr. Linden's face; as if she&#xD;
wanted his Vook to authenticate all these messages, or to&#xD;
meet her own heart's answer. At any rate it was not .till&#xD;
after a good study of the little picture that Faith put it&#xD;
away and took out her letter.&#xD;
It wa~ not just like having him there to talk or caress&#xD;
away her discomfort-and yet it was like it, though the&#xD;
pages were well on their way before the trousseau was even&#xD;
alluded to. But the words, the atmosphere of the letter&#xD;
made Faith breathe easier,-it was like the wand of the&#xD;
Fairy Order, smoothing out the little tangled skeins of&#xD;
silk. And when that subject came up, it was touched so&#xD;
lightly, so delicately, yet with such evident pleasure,-.--there&#xD;
was such mingling of play and earnest in the charge given&#xD;
her to be ready before he came, and such a strong wish that&#xD;
he could have saved her all the work,-the terror of the&#xD;
trousseau could not stand before it. And at the hope that&#xD;
her taste would be suited, Faith's heart made a spring the&#xD;
other way. She drank in every word of the letter; and&#xD;
then feeling healed, though tender-spirited yet, she finished&#xD;
putting away her riches and went down stairs.&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick having gone off to attend to dinner pre..&#xD;
operations, Miss Linden sat alone, singing to herself softly&#xD;
in company with the March wind and the fire, and (of all&#xD;
things!) at work upon one of Miss Bezac's mantillas. Faith's&#xD;
two hands were laid upon the one which held the needle.&#xD;
"Not to-day-" said the silver voice which Miss Linden&#xD;
must learn to know.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Yes-unless you'll give me somewhat else to do !" she&#xD;
said leaning her sunshiny head back against Faith. "I was&#xD;
out of patience with myself because I could not do what&#xD;
no o~e but Endecott could-so in my woman's pride I took&#xD;
up ~mething which he couldn't. What are you going to&#xD;
do, darling?"&#xD;
Faith thought she knew why she was called "Pet"-but&#xD;
she only kissed her. "I shall have to ask you a great deal&#xD;
about those things up stairs," she said;-" but to-day I&#xD;
want to see you. What would you like ?"&#xD;
The thing Miss Linden liked best, was to see some of&#xD;
her brother's old haunts;~ and a notable* drive the two had&#xD;
that afternoon. Wherein, under the light of a Spring day,&#xD;
Miss Linden saw Pattaquasset, the Quapaw people, (part;&#xD;
of them) and not least of all, Faith herself; who showed&#xD;
herself very much as the Spring day. And of Mr. Linden&#xD;
his sister talked the while, to her heart's content, and Faith's&#xD;
~in the full joy of that affection which can never say enough,&#xD;
speaking, to that which can never hear too much.&#xD;
It would be long to tell how the trousseau was made up.&#xD;
Mrs. Iredell came from Pequot and established herself in a&#xD;
farmhouse at Pattaquasset; and the two future sisters put&#xD;
their heads and their hands-a good deal of their hearts&#xD;
too - into the work that was done in Faith's blue-wain-&#xD;
scotted white room. There they sat and sewed, day after&#xD;
day; while the days grew warm, and the apple blossoms&#xD;
burst, and the robins whistled. They whistled of Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den's coming home, to Faith, and sent her needle with a&#xD;
quicker impulse. She never spoke of it.&#xD;
But Miss Linden knew whither the look went, that seemed&#xD;
to go no further than the apple trees; and what was the&#xD;
pressure that made a quick breath now and then and a&#xD;
hurried finger. Perhaps her own pulses began to move&#xD;
with accelerated beat. And when towards the end of M&amp;amp;y&#xD;
Mrs. Iredell found business occasion for being in Quilipeak&#xD;
a fortnight, Pet so urged upon Mrs. Derrick the advan.&#xD;
tages of the scheme, that she carried off Faith with her.&#xD;
It would break the waiting and watching, and act as a&#xD;
diversion, she said,-and Faith did not contradict her.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
TI~STABLISHE1~'Tair1Y in that great Quilipeak hotel,&#xD;
lilA Faith found her way of life very pleasant. Mrs. Ire-&#xD;
dell was much in her own room, coming out now and then&#xD;
for a while to watch the two young things at their work.&#xD;
A pretty sight !-.for some of the work had been brought'&#xD;
along,-fast getting finished now, ~inder the witching of&#xD;
'sweet counsel.' Miss Linden declared that for her part&#xD;
she was s9rry it was so near done,-what Faith thought&#xD;
about it she did not say.&#xD;
Meantime, June was using her rosy wings day by day,&#xD;
and in another week Mr. Linden might be looked for. Just&#xD;
what steamer he would take was a little uncertain, but from&#xD;
that time two people at least would begin to hope, and a&#xD;
day or two before that time they were to go back to Patta-&#xD;
quasset.&#xD;
The. week was m~ear the ending-so was the work,-and&#xD;
in their pretty parlour the two ladies wrought on as usual.&#xD;
The morning had been spent in explorations with Reuben&#xD;
Taylor and Sam Stoutenburgh, and now it was afternoon&#xD;
of a cool June day, with a fresh breeze scouting round to&#xD;
see what sweets it could pick up, and coming in at the open&#xD;
window to report. On the table was a delicate tinted sum-&#xD;
mer muslin spread out to receive its trimming, ~wer which&#xD;
Faith and Miss Linden stood an cL,~ debated and laughed,-&#xD;
then Faith went back to her low~ eat in the window and&#xD;
the hem of a pocket handkerchie_ half looking out&#xD;
and half in,-the quiet street sounds murmuring with the&#xD;
rustle of the many elm leaves,.-Faith sat, the wind playing&#xD;
Cupid to her Psyche; and Miss Linden stood by the table&#xD;
and the muslin dress.&#xD;
"Faith," she said contemplatively, "What flowers do you&#xD;
suppose Endecott would get you to wear with this-out of&#xD;
a garden full?"&#xD;
"It is di~cult to tell"-.-.-said Faith; "he finds just what&#xD;
he wants, just where I shouldn't look for it." And a vision&#xD;

fancy.&#xD;
"Very true," said Miss Linden,-" precisely what Aunt&#xD;
iredell said when she first saw you,~-but I am inclined to&#xD;
think, that the first day you appear in this you will see him&#xD;
appear with a bunch of white roses-probably Lamarques;&#xD;
if "&#xD;
"Why Lamarques ?" said Faith sewing away. "Pet, how&#xD;
pleasant this wind is."&#xD;
Miss Linden did not immediately answer. She stood&#xD;
resting her finger tips on the muslin dress, looking down&#xD;
at it with an intentness that might have seen through thicker&#xD;
stuW the colour in her cheeks deepening and deepening.&#xD;
"Why ?" she said abstractedly,-" they're beautiful-don't&#xD;
you think so?-~Oh Faith !"-With a joyous clasp of the&#xD;
hands she sprang to the window, and dropped the curtain&#xD;
like a screen before her. There was no time to ask ques-&#xD;
tions-nor need. Faith heard the opening door, the word&#xD;
spoken to the waiter,-saw Mr. Linden himself come in.&#xD;
Pet sprang towards him with a joyful exclamation-an&#xD;
unselfish one, as it seemed; for after a moment's concen-&#xD;
trated embrace which embodied the warmth of half a dozen,&#xD;
she disappeared out of the room. Mr. Linden came for-&#xD;
ward, looking after her at first with surprise,.-then as if a&#xD;
possible explanation occurred to him, he stood still by the&#xD;
mantelpiece, watching the door by which she had tone.&#xD;
Faith had waited behind her screen-she could not have&#xD;
told why-utterly motionless for that minute; then a little&#xD;
quick push sent the curtain aside, and she came to him.&#xD;
"Faith !" he exclaimed-" are you hiding from me&#xD;
My dear Mignonette "&#xD;
She hid from him then,-all her face could; for her glad-&#xD;
ness was of that kind which banishes colour instead of bring-&#xD;
ing it. He let her stand so a few minutes, himself very&#xD;
silent ~and still; then one hand brought her face within&#xD;
reach.&#xD;
"Little bird !" he said, "I have you safe now,-you need&#xD;
not flutter any more&#xD;
Perhaps that thought was hardly composing, for Faith's&#xD;
head drooped yet, in a statue-like stillness. Not very&#xD;
unlike a bird on its rest however, albeit her gravity was&#xD;

profound. And rest-.---to speak it fairly-is a serious thing&#xD;
p~ anybody, when it has beau in dbt or jeopardy, or long&#xD;
withheld. What could be done to bring the colour back,&#xD;
that Mr. Linden tried.&#xD;
"Faith," he said, "is this all I am to have from your&#xD;
lips-of any sort? Where did you get such pale cheeks,&#xD;
precious one ?--did I frighten you by coming so suddenly?&#xD;
You have not been ill again ?"&#xD;
"No,".-she said, raising her eyes for the first time to&#xD;
look fairly in his face. But that look brought Faith back&#xD;
to herself; and though she drooped her head again, it was&#xD;
for another reason, and her words were in a different key.&#xD;
4~XJe~Te didn't expect you for a week more."&#xD;
"No-because I didn't want you to be watching the&#xD;
winds. Mignonette, look up !"&#xD;
Which she did, frankly,.-her eyes as delicious a com-&#xD;
pound of gravity and gladness as any man need wish to have&#xD;
bestowed upon him. "Pet brought me here7-" she said.&#xD;
"Well do you suppose I have brought an invoice of&#xD;
Dutch patience ?"&#xD;
"I don't think you gre particularly patient7"-~aid Faith&#xD;
demurely,-" except when you choose. Oh Endy !-"&#xD;
That last note had the true ring of joy. Her forehead&#xD;
touched his shoulder again; the rest of hera sentence was&#xD;
unspoken.&#xD;
I do not choose, to-day, Mignonette,-therefore tell me&#xD;
-do you think I have had all I am fairly entitled to ?"&#xD;
She flushed all over, but lifted up her head and kissed&#xD;
him. Mr. Linden watched her, smiling then though she&#xD;
might not see it.&#xD;
"My little beauty," he said, "you have grown afraid of&#xD;
me-do you know that?"&#xD;
"Not very-" she said. Certainly Faith was not good&#xD;
at defending herself.&#xD;
"No, not very. Just enough to give us both something&#xD;
to do. Mignonette, are you ready for me&#xD;
Faith's face was bowed. again almost out of sight. "Don't&#xD;
you think," she half whispered, "that Pet must be ready to&#xD;
~ee you, by this time ?"&#xD;
For all answer-except a smile-she was led across the&#xD;
room to a seat near the window. I~ut just there, was the&#xD;

table and its muslin dress! Mr. Linden stopped short, and&#xD;
Faith felt and understood the clasp of his arm about li~er&#xD;
waist, of his hand upon hers. But he only said laughiru'v.&#xD;
"Faith, was that what made you hide away ?" Th&#xD;
"Pet hid me,"-Faith said. very much abashed ;-." n oti.&#xD;
She let fall the curtain."&#xD;
Mr. Linden let it fall again, in effect, for he quitted all&#xD;
troublesome subjects, and sat down by her side; not loosing&#xD;
his hold of her, indeed, nor taking his eyes from her, but&#xD;
in the gravity of his own deep happiness there was not&#xD;
much to disturb her quiet.&#xD;
"I sent you a telegraphic dispatch this morning to Pat-&#xD;
taquasset, dear Faith,-I did not mean to take you qnite&#xD;
by siwprise. And my stopping anywhere short of that was&#xD;
merely because the arrangement of trains forced me to lose&#xD;
an hour here on the way. I thought it lost."&#xD;
- "It hasn't proved so."&#xD;
"There was such a doubt of my being in time for this&#xD;
steamer, that I would not even speak of it. Faith, I have&#xD;
not often heard such music as the swash of the water about&#xD;
her paddle-wheels as we set off."&#xD;
"Didn't you hear thee swash of her paddle-wheels as you&#xD;
came in ?" said Faith merrily.&#xD;
"No!" The wistful gladness of her eye was a pretty&#xD;
commentary.&#xD;
"Is Miss Reason in fall activity yet ?" said Mr. Linden&#xD;
smiling,-his comment.&#xD;
"She has had no interruption, you know, for a great&#xD;
while."&#xD;
"Take care of her, Faith-she has a great deal of work&#xD;
before her." The look that answered this was a little con-&#xD;
scious, but showed no fear.&#xD;
There was nothing very unreasonable in the face that&#xD;
bent over hers; the eyes with their deep look, lit up now&#xD;
and then with flashes of different feelings; the mouth wear-&#xD;
ing its sweet changeable expression. A little browner than&#xD;
usual, from the voyage,-a little thinner, perhaps, with hard&#xD;
work; Mr. Linden still looked remarkably well and like&#xD;
himself; though Faith felt that nameless change-~that&#xD;
mingling of real and unreal, of friend and stranger, which&#xD;
a long absence always brings. One minute he was himself,&#xD;
&#xD;
as he had been in Pattaquasset,-giviflg her lessons, riding&#xD;
~jth her, reading to her, going off to school with one of&#xD;
Mv Stoutenburgh's white roses. The next-he was ai&#xD;
g eman just arrived from Europe !-.-from whom she&#xD;
0ouid not get away. Perhaps the last impression was the&#xD;
most remarkable. But in spite of this, Faith was herself,&#xD;
every inch of her; with the exception of that one little dif~&#xD;
ference which Mr. Linden had pointed out and which was&#xD;
not to be denied.&#xD;
Some time had passed, when Faith felt Pet's little hand&#xD;
come round her neck-the other was round Mr. Linden.&#xD;
Faith's start was instant; springing up she went to the&#xD;
window where ~behind the curtain lay thQ work her hand&#xD;
had dropped. Faith gathered it up. She would have put&#xD;
that muslin dress out of the way then !-.but there it lay in&#xD;
plain sight and~ close neighbourhood. Yet somebody must&#xD;
do it, aud it was her business; and with cheeks of a very&#xD;
l)retty deep rose that set off her white drapery, Faith ap~&#xD;
plied herself to the due folding of the troublesome muslin.&#xD;
In two minutes Pet came to help her, but in a different&#xD;
mood, though her eyelashes were glittering.&#xD;
"Endy, come here and look at this-I - think it is so&#xD;
~retty. What flowers must Faith wear with it ?"&#xD;
"Oarnations look very well."&#xD;
"I said white roses. -&#xD;
"Which will you wear, Migwonette ?" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
IJe was favoured with a glance from two gentle eyes,&#xD;
which it was worth a little wickedness to get. It was only&#xD;
a flash. "I think Pet is right, "-she answered with great&#xD;
gravity.&#xD;
He came close to her side, the low-spoken "you shall&#xD;
have them-" touched more things than one.&#xD;
"What do you suppose I found her doing?" said Pet,&#xD;
folding down a sleeve.&#xD;
"Pet !".-s~siid Faith. "Doll't touch that! ~ot to-night."&#xD;
"Do you xvish me to leave it unfolded ?-the servants&#xD;
will perhaps sweep in the morning."&#xD;
"Pet," said Faith sofdy,.-.--."don't yoit raise a dust! We&#xD;
might not lay it so soon."&#xD;
"Endy," said his sister, "how do you do ?-yuu haven't&#xD;
told me."&#xD;

"Perfectly well, dear Pet."&#xD;
"Turn round to the light and let me see-.-You've grown&#xD;
thin, chIld ~"&#xD;
He laughed-giving her a kiss and embrace to make up&#xD;
for that; which was oniy half successful. But she spoke&#xD;
in her former tone.&#xD;
"He looks pretty strong, Faith,.-.--I think ]I might tell&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Mr. Linden," said Faith, "won't you please ask Pet&#xD;
not to tell you something?"&#xD;
"I will ask you," he said softly, laying his hands lightly&#xD;
on h~r shoulders. "Faith-I think we may dispense with&#xD;
'Mr. Linden' now, even before people."&#xD;
She was oddly abashed; glanced up at him and glanced&#xD;
down, with the grave air of a rebuked child. There was&#xD;
nothing about it that was ~ot pretty; and the next thing&#xD;
her eyes ~vent to Pet. How lovely and precious she looked&#xD;
as she stood there! with her sweet shy face and changing&#xD;
colours. Mr. Linden held her to his breast and kissed her&#xD;
more than once,-but in a way that was beyond chiding.&#xD;
"Why must I ask Pet not to tell me something?"&#xD;
"It is nothing great !"-said Faith stammering over her&#xD;
words-" Only you won't like it very well-but you will&#xD;
have to hear it. I thought another time-that's all."&#xD;
"He'll never hear it from you-what I mean," said Miss&#xD;
Linden, "so he shall from me. We'lI see whether he likes&#xD;
it. Know then, Endecott, that I found this child absorbed&#xD;
in wedding dresses !"&#xD;
"Wedding dresses !" he repeated. "More than one&#xD;
"Oh Endy," said his sister with a sort of laughing mi-&#xD;
patience, "what a boy you are! II mean other people's."&#xD;
Faith stood smiling a little, letting her manage it her own&#xD;
way.&#xD;
"Imagine It," Miss Linden went on,-" imagine this one&#xD;
little real flower bending over a xvhole garden of muslin&#xD;
marigolds and silk sunflowers and velvet verbenas, growing&#xD;
unthriftily in a bed of white muslin I" Mr. Linden laughed,&#xD;
as if the picture were a pleasant one.&#xD;
'~Mignonette," he said,-" how could you bear the sight ?"&#xD;
"I was trying to make the best of it."&#xD;
"In whose behalf were you so much interested ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Maria Davids," said Faith glancing up at him. "But&#xD;
I was not interested,-only so far as one is in making the&#xD;
best of anything."&#xD;
"Who is trying to make the best of her ?"&#xD;
Faith looked down and looked grave as she answered&#xD;
.-" Jonathan ~ Mr. Linden's face was grave too,&#xD;
then, with the recollections that name brought up.&#xD;
"There is one place in the house she cannot touch," he&#xD;
said. "Faith, I am glad'she is not to take care of him."&#xD;
"I have thought that so often !"&#xD;
"Do you 1ike.~my story, Endy ?" said Miss Linden pres-&#xD;
ently.&#xD;
"Very much-the subject. I am less interested in the&#xD;
application. Who next is to be married in Pattaquasset ?"&#xD;
"I don't know"&#xD;
"Aunt Ired says she wishes yo~ would be married&#xD;
here," observed Pet demurely. To which insinuation Faith&#xD;
opposed as demure a silence.&#xD;
"Oh Endecott," said his sister changing her ,tone and&#xD;
speaking in that mixed mood which so well became her,-~&#xD;
"I'm so happy~that you are here! This week Faith has&#xD;
been pretty quiet, by dint of being away from home; but&#xD;
nothing would have kept her here next week-and I had&#xD;
been thinking what we should do,-if the week should run&#xD;
on into two-or if the wind should blow !" She spoke&#xD;
laughingly, yet with a voice not quite steady.&#xD;
"'So he bringeth them to the haven where they would&#xD;
be' I" Mr.. Linden said. But his voice was clear as the&#xD;
very depth of feeling of which it told. "Aunt Iredell cannot&#xD;
have her wish, Pet," he added presently,-" there would be&#xD;
at least three negative votes."&#xD;
"I suppose that! But I shall come down Saturday to&#xD;
hear what wishes are in progress."&#xD;
"Won't you go with us, Pet, to-morrow ?" said Faith&#xD;
earnestly. She had been standing in a sort of abstracted&#xD;
~ silence.&#xD;
"No, pretty sister, I will not. But I shall keep all those&#xD;
ruffles here to flnish7iind Saturday Reuben Taylor shall&#xD;
escor~ them and me to Pattaquasset."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
&#xD;
T 'IJINGS were yet iii their morning light and, shadow&#xD;
when Faith set oft' on this her first real journey with&#xD;
Mr. Linden. She felt the strangeness of it,-in the e~Iy&#xD;
breakfast, the drive alone with him to the station,-.to stand&#xD;
by and see him get her ticket, to sit with him alone in the&#xD;
cars (there seemed to be no one else there!) were all new.&#xD;
The towers of Quilipeak rose up in the soft distance, shin.&#xD;
ing in the morning sun: over meadow and hillside and In-&#xD;
dian-named river the summer light fell in all its beauty.&#xD;
Dewdrops glittered on waving grain and mown grass;&#xD;
laborers in their shirtsleeves ma~ e another gleaming line&#xD;
df scythe blades, or followed the t~ ams of red and brindled&#xD;
oxen that bowed their heads to the heavy yoke. Through&#xD;
all this, past all this, the Pequot train flew on towards Pat-&#xD;
taquasset; sending whole lines of white smoke to scour the&#xD;
country, despatching the shrill echoes of its whistle in swift&#xD;
pursuit.&#xD;
Faith saw it all with that vividness of impression which&#xD;
leaves everything sun-pictured on the memory forever. In&#xD;
it all she felt a strange 'something new' ;-which gave the&#xD;
sunlight such a marked brilliance, and made dewdrops&#xD;
fresher than ordinary, and bestowed on mown grass and&#xD;
waving grain such rich tints and gracious motion. It was&#xD;
not merely the happiness of the time ;-Faith's foot had a&#xD;
little odd feeling that every step was on new ground. It&#xD;
was a thoughtful ride to Pattaquasset, though she was in.&#xD;
nocently busy with all pleasant things that came in her way,&#xD;
and the silveriest of tones called Mr. Linden~'s attention to&#xD;
them. He did not leave her thoughts too much chance to&#xD;
muse: the country, the various towns, gave subject enoQgh&#xD;
for the varied comment and information Faith loved so&#xD;
much. Mr. Linden knew the places well, anV their history&#xD;
and legends, and the foreign scenes that were like-or unlike&#xD;
-them,-or perhaps a hayfield brought up stories of foreign&#xD;
agriculture, or a white sailing cloud carried them both off&#xD;
(398)&#xD;
&#xD;
to castles in the air. One thing Mr. Linden might have&#xD;
made known more fully than he did-.-and that was his com-&#xD;
panion. For several times in the course of the morning,&#xD;
~rst in the station at Quilipeak, then in the cars, some friend&#xD;
or acquaintance of his own came to greet or welcome him.&#xD;
And Faith could see the curiosity that glanced at so much&#xD;
of her as her veil left in view,-..-Mr5 Linden saw it too, with&#xD;
some amusement. And yet though all this was a little&#xD;
roughing, it was interesting to her in another way,-shew-&#xD;
ing her Mr. Linden as she had never seen him, among the&#xD;
rest of the worid,.-giving her little glimpses of his former&#xD;
life; for the hits of talk were sometimes quite prolonged.&#xD;
"Mignonette," he said after one of these occasions,&#xD;
"some people here are Very anxious to make your acquaint-&#xD;
ance."&#xD;
"I am glad you don't want to gratify them."&#xD;
"Why ?-Jn the first place, I do."&#xD;
"Do you !"-said Faith, somewhat fearfully.&#xD;
"Certainly. I, like you, am 'a little proud of my carna-&#xD;
tion~'. How do you like this way of travelling ?"&#xD;
"I like it such a morning as this,~ said Faith. "I don't&#xD;
think it's the pleasantest. But today it's delicious."&#xD;
"Yes-to-day," he repeated. "What way of travelling&#xD;
do you like best ?"&#xD;
"You know I never travelled at all, except to Quilipeak&#xD;
and Pequot. I believe I like a wagon or a sleigh better&#xD;
than this,--in general."&#xD;
"That is our last whistling post !" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Faith, I shall be glad to get rid of that veil. And I&#xD;
have so many things to say to you that cannot be said here.&#xD;
Is Mr. Somers in Pa~taquasset still ?"&#xD;
"Everybody's there-" Faith answered.&#xD;
The little shake of the head with which this intelligence&#xD;
(so far as regarded Mr. Somers) was received, Faith might&#xD;
understand as she pleased, for in another minute they were&#xD;
at the Pattaquasset station; the train was puffing off; and&#xD;
she standing there on the ~Aatform with Mr. Linden. A.&#xD;
little way back was Jerry and the wagon-that Faith saw&#xD;
at a glance; but there to~, and much nearer, was Squire&#xD;
Stoutenburgh-in do bt whether to handle the new corners&#xD;
separately or together)in his great delight.&#xD;

&#xD;
From all this Mr. Linden rescued Faith with most&#xD;
prompt skill; carried her off to the wagon, shook hands&#xD;
with Dromy and dismissed him, and then with the reins in&#xD;
his own hands had her all to himself once more. And&#xD;
Jerry dashed on as if he knew his driver.&#xD;
"Mign onette, please put back your veil," ~vere the first&#xD;
words. Which Faith did, and looked at him, laughing,&#xD;
blushing and a little shy, all in one pleasant combination.&#xD;
"What have you been doing to make yourself lovelier,&#xD;
little Sunbeam ?"&#xD;
"I have been a year ivithout seeing you,".-.~aid Faith&#xD;
with excellent seriousness.&#xD;
"My presence seems to have no counteracting effect. By&#xD;
the same rule, I should be-marvellous I Do you perceive&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
Her eye gave one of its little flashes, but Faith imme.&#xD;
diately looked away.&#xD;
"Do you know," said Mr. Linden, "I can hardly believe&#xD;
that this year of exile is over-and that there are none&#xD;
others to follow it. What do you suppose will be the first&#xD;
subject you and I shalr consider ?"&#xD;
"Mr. Skip," said Faith gravely.&#xD;
"Mr. Skip merits no consideration whatever. Is Miss&#xD;
Bezac at work on that dress ?"&#xD;
"Because he don't live with us any longer, Endecott."&#xD;
"Does he not ?-IJnfortunate man I"&#xD;
"And Dromy is in his place."&#xD;
"My dear, my own place is the only one I can think of&#xD;
with any intense interest. Except yours."&#xD;
''Because we have had no farm to manage this winter,~~&#xD;
said Faith; "so Dromy could d~ what we wanted."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear it," said IMIr. Lin den,-." he never used&#xD;
to be able to do what I wanted. Who has managed for&#xD;
you? Mr. Simlins? And has Mr. Skip gone. off in a&#xD;
pumpkin with Cinderella? Faith, there is the door where'&#xD;
I had the first sight of you-my Rose of delight !" he&#xD;
added softly, as if all the days since then were passing&#xD;
through his mind in sweet procession.&#xD;
Faith was silent, for she too had something to think of;&#xD;
and there was no more time to finish either train of conver-&#xD;
sation that had beQn started. Both dropped, even before&#xD;
&#xD;
* Jerry drew up at the gate; and if she had not gained one&#xD;
object she had the other.&#xD;
By this time it was about eleven o'clock. It was rarely&#xD;
very hot in Pattaquasset; and now though under a sunny&#xD;
sky there were summer breezes rustling ifl the trees. Both&#xD;
mingled in Faith's senses with the joy of going into that&#xD;
hoi~se again so accompanied. That gladness of getting&#xD;
home in a pleasant hour! No one was in the cool sitting-&#xD;
room-Faith pushed open the door between and went into&#xD;
the eating-room, followed by Mr. Linden. There was Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick; and what of all things doing but doing up some&#xD;
of Faith's new ruffles! It was a glad meeting, -what&#xD;
though Mrs. Derrick had no hand to give anybody. Then she&#xD;
went to get rid of the starch, and the two others to their&#xD;
respective rooms. But in a very few minutes indeed Faith&#xD;
was by her side again.&#xD;
"Mother-has Cindy come&#xD;
"She's coming to-morrow, child. But there's not much&#xD;
to do for dinner,-that's all under way."&#xD;
Faith bared her arms and plunged into dairy and kitchen&#xD;
to do all that her mother characterized as 'not much,' and&#xD;
a little more. When every possible item had been cared&#xD;
for-the strawberries looked over-the cream made ready&#xD;
-the table set- the lettuce washed -the dishes warming&#xD;
for the vegetables -the pickles and biiead on the table-and&#xD;
Faith had through all this delighted Mrs. Derrick as much&#xD;
as possible with her company, sight and presence at least,-&#xD;
for Faith's words were a trifle less free than usual ;.-when&#xD;
it was all done and the eating..room in a state of pleasant&#xD;
shady summer readiness, Faith went 'ben', as they say in Scot-&#xD;
land. She ~came into the sitting-room, as quietly as usual,&#xD;
and coming up to Mr. Linden laid a hand on his shoulder.&#xD;
"My own dear little Mignonette ! - Do you feel less&#xD;
afraid of me, now I am here ?"&#xD;
She hesitated to answer at first, then spoke with a very&#xD;
dainty shy look-" I don't think I ever had fear enough of&#xD;
you to hurt anything."&#xD;
"See that you do not begin now! What have you been&#xD;
about, all these long months? You were as chary of&#xD;
details as if I had no right to them."&#xD;
Faith looked gi'avely out of the window before she&#xD;

8aid, "I have not been studying this year, J~ndecott.'&#xD;
There was so clearly some reason for it, that Mr. Lindeu'~&#xD;
first thought was one of anxiety.&#xD;
"What has been the matter ?"&#xD;
"You know I told you i~1ir. Skip had gone away ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"And that he went because we hadn't any farm to&#xD;
manage ?"&#xD;
"What has the farm to do with your studies ?"&#xD;
"What shall I do if I make you very ang~~y with me ?"&#xD;
said Faith, the least touch of seriousness mingling with her&#xD;
words.&#xD;
"You ha\I better ask what I shall do. Has Mr. Deacon&#xD;
come back and taken possession ?"&#xD;
"Yes..-And you know, Endy, we used to live by the farm.&#xD;
-When that was gone we had to live by something else,&#xD;
I wouldn't tell you if I could help your knowing it."&#xD;
"Mignonette, what have you been doing?"&#xD;
"You know what Pet found me at ?"&#xD;
"Yes."-.--She could not tell whether he saw the whole,-.-.&#xD;
he was clearly in the mind to hear it, taking both her&#xD;
hands in his.&#xD;
)     "I did that," said Faith.&#xD;
"Did what?"&#xD;
"I got work from Miss Bezac..-.-She gave me lessons."&#xD;
"For how long ?"&#xD;
"Since-about a fortnight after you went away. It was&#xD;
then Squire Deacon took away the farm. From that time&#xD;
until Pet came .-.-" she added with a little rise of colour&#xD;
in her cheeks.&#xD;
"And that all the daylight and candlelight hours of each&#xD;
day?"&#xD;
7' 0 no, not that. I had long walks to Miss Bezac's, you&#xD;
1kn ow-or rides-every day or two; for we kept Jerry; and&#xD;
I never sewed before breakfast. And in the evening I used&#xD;
to write letters.-..part of the evening.".&#xD;
"Child! child !"-He dropped her hands and began to&#xD;
pace up and down the moderate limits of Mrs. Derrick's&#xD;
best carpet. Until after a few turns Faith put herself&#xD;
straight in his way and intercepted him, with a very inno~.&#xD;
cent face.&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
iit&#xD;
&#xD;
"Faith, did no one 'protest against this-for me&#xD;
"Yes, sir."-&#xD;
"And you knew that I had guarded-that I had tried to&#xD;
guard you-against any such possibility ?"&#xD;
Faith paused. "Yes, I knew,-but Endy, that couldn't&#xD;
make any difference."&#xD;
"It did not-How, could not ?"&#xD;
"It ought not," she said softly and coloring.&#xD;
"Can you tell why ?"&#xD;
"You know, Endy, 'it was better,-it was right,-it was&#xD;
better that I should work for myself."&#xD;
"Never, Mignon ette-while I could work for you. How&#xD;
do you expect to manage when you are my wife ?-And do&#xD;
you think I had no right even to know about it ?"&#xD;
"I thought-now was the best time-" Faith said.&#xD;
"Am I to learn from this and similar instances what my&#xD;
wife will expect of me if I chance to be sick or in trouble ?"&#xD;
It touched her. She coloured again to th~ roots of her&#xD;
hair.&#xD;
"Do you think I did wrong, Endy ?" 'she said doubtfully,&#xD;
yet in an appealing fashion&#xD;
"I cannot say you did right."&#xD;
"But when you could do me no good,"--.-.said Faith very&#xD;
gently, -." and I should only have given you pain -A.for&#xD;
nothing ?"&#xD;
"It ~ou1d not have given me pain to have you tell it-.&#xD;
and the thing does now. Besides, in a great many cases&#xD;
the thought that it is pain 'for nothing' is a mistake. I might&#xD;
know some remedy when you did not. Self sacrifice will&#xD;
never run wild in my nature-as it is inclined to do in&#xD;
yours, but just imagine it once in the ascendant and me&#xD;
with a bad headache (which I never have), -it can only&#xD;
give you pain to hear of it-so I tell you of it the next&#xD;
day. But if I had told you at the time-what conjurations&#xD;
of your little fingers! what quick-witted alleviations !-till&#xD;
the headache becomes almost a pleasure to both of us."&#xD;
Faith was very near the unwanted demonstration of&#xD;
te~rs. She stood still, looking down, till she could look up&#xD;
safely.&#xD;
"I will not do so again, Endy.-About important things,&#xD;
I mean?'&#xD;

&#xD;
"You know, Faith, I am speaking less of this one case,&#xD;
than of the daily course of future action. Is not perfect&#xD;
frankness, as well as\ perfect truth, best? And if I call for&#xD;
your sympathy in all manner of small and great thino'&#xD;
you let mine lie idle ?"                      ~s, will&#xD;
"I might like it,".-.--said Faith honestly. "But in great&#xD;
things I will not again, Endecott."&#xD;
"Take care you get the right measure for things," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden smiling. "Frankness makes a deliciously plain&#xD;
way for one's feet.'!&#xD;
Faith looked sober again, at the idea that she should&#xD;
have failed in frankness. Then put her hand in his and&#xD;
looked smiling up at him.&#xD;
"There is one thing I will not keep from you any longer,"&#xD;
-she said.&#xD;
"What is that ?-the seal of this little compact of plain&#xD;
speaking ?"x&#xD;
"Strawberries !"-&#xD;
"Only another style of nomenclature,"-said Mr. Lin..&#xD;
den.&#xD;
"You must take the trouble to go into the other room&#xD;
for them."&#xD;
And light-heartedly Faith preceded him into the other&#xD;
room, where the dinner was ready. A very simple dinner,&#xD;
but Mrs. Derrick would not have had anything less than a&#xD;
roast chicken for Mr. Linden, and the lettuce and potatoes&#xD;
did very well for a summer day; and Faith's waiting on&#xD;
table made it only more pleasant. Talk flowed all the&#xD;
while; of a thousand and one things; fQr Mrs. Derrick's&#xD;
sympathies had a widel' range since Mr. Linden had been&#xD;
in Germany. Indeed the talk was principally between&#xD;
those two. It was a remarkably long dinner without mul-&#xD;
tiplication of courses-there was so much to say! Many&#xD;
were the pleasant things swallowed with the strawberries.&#xD;
It is said hunger is the best sauce' it&#xD;
is a better.                  , 's not true; happiness&#xD;
And then-what came then? Truly, the same over again&#xD;
-looking and talking, without the strawberries. Which&#xD;
were not wanted; especially when Faith was dressed out&#xD;
with roses, as she was presently after dinner. As she would&#xD;
wash the tumblers and spoons in th~ dining-room, spite of&#xD;
&#xD;
all Mrs. Derrick' could say, ~ Mr. Linden would stay there&#xD;
too; not indeed to do anything but Jook on, and bestow&#xD;
the roses as aforesaid. Talking to her sometimes in En~&#xD;
~lish, sometimes in French, with preliminary instructions&#xD;
in German.&#xD;
"Mignonette," he said, "I have three letters for you to&#xD;
read."&#xD;
"Letters, Endecott !-Who has written to me ?"&#xD;
"Through me-three regions of ~ountry."&#xD;
"What do you mean&#xD;
Just as ~he spoke the words, Faith paused and set down&#xD;
the tumbler she was wiping. Her ears had caught the&#xD;
sound of a modest knock at the front door. She looked at&#xD;
Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Stay here, Endy---.please !" she said as she threw, down&#xD;
her towel and ran off But Faith's hope of a chance was&#xD;
disappointed., She ushered somebody into the sitting-room&#xD;
an~ came back gravely and flushed to Mr. Linden.&#xD;
~'Jt's Mr. Somers-and he wants to see you, Ende-&#xD;
cott !"-.&#xD;
Jaith went at her tumblers, and simultaneously, greatly&#xD;
to the dismay of one party as to the surprise of the other,&#xD;
in walked Mr. Somers after her.&#xD;
"Miss Derrick told me you were in this room, sir," said&#xD;
the clergyman shaking Mr. Linden's hand,-" so I came&#xD;
in. Ha! I am glad to be one of the first to welcome you&#xD;
back. How do you do, Mr. Linden? You've been a gveat&#xD;
while from Pattaquasset !-and you've been missed, I don't&#xD;
doubt."&#xD;
Apparently not by Mr. Somers! But Mr. Linden met&#xD;
all the advances as he should, merely stating his belief in&#xD;
the general proposition that there is always somebody to&#xD;
miss everybody."&#xD;
"Will you take a seat here, sir ?" he said---" or may I go&#xD;
with you to the next room&#xD;
"I-.4iave no choice," said Mr. Somers looking benig-&#xD;
nantly around ;-~.--." it is very pleasant here, very !-cool ;-&#xD;
perhaps Miss Derrick will have no objection to our taking&#xD;
our seats here ?".--.&#xD;
Faith did not say, but as Mr. Somers had taken her leave&#xD;
for granted, and his seat consequently, she was saved that&#xD;

&#xD;
trouble. flow she. reddened at the thought of the rose~&#xD;
with which she was' dressed! And there she stood in full&#xD;
view, washing her spoons! But Mr. Somers looked the&#xD;
other way.&#xD;
"I-I am very happy to see you again, Mr. Linden.&#xD;
very happy indeed, sir! I heard from Squire Stoutenburgh&#xD;
that you were expected5 and Ii lost no time. How have you&#xD;
enjoyed' your health, sir, this year? A year's a, long time!&#xD;
isn't it ?"&#xD;
Mr. Linden, taking his seat as in duty bound, looked&#xD;
abstractedly at Faith and the spoons and the' roses, and&#xD;
answered according to the evidence.&#xD;
"Yes? Mr. Somers,.-and yet it depends very much upon&#xD;
how far the two ends of the year are apart in other re-&#xD;
spects. The ' Voyage auteur de ma chambre' could never&#xD;
seem very long, whatever time it took~"&#xD;
"Ha !"-said Mr. Somers blandly,-he hadn't the re..&#xD;
niotest idea what this speech might mean,-" no. Did you&#xD;
have a good passage coming over? We had every sign&#xD;
of it."&#xD;
"Very good,"-said Mr. Linden smiling,-" and very&#xD;
stormy."&#xD;
"Ah ?"-said Mr. Somers,-." very good and very stormy?&#xD;
Well I shouldn't have thought that. But I suppose you&#xD;
have got to be such a traveller that you don't mind which&#xD;
way the wind blows, if it blows you on, ha ?.-like Dr.&#xD;
Harrison. He never minds the weather. Dr. Harrison's&#xD;
a great loss to Pattaquasset too," said Mr. Somers looking&#xD;
at Faith and smiling a little more openly ;-" all our-ha!&#xD;
.-our pleasantest' members of society seem to be running&#xD;
away from us! That's what Mrs. Somers says."&#xD;
"One more spoon-and put them up,"-thought Faith,&#xD;
.-." and then I'll be away !"~-.-.&#xD;
"But I've come to see if I can't get you to do me a&#xD;
favour, Mr. Linden," said Mr. Somers withdrawing his ey~~&#xD;
and mind from her. "I-should be very much obliged to&#xD;
you indeed! I'm almost afraid to ask, for fear I sha'n'1&#xD;
get it."&#xD;
Faith wiped her spoon slowly.&#xD;
"I like to do favorss" said Mr. Lindenb-" at least ~&#xD;
think I should. But I cannot imagine how you can give&#xD;
me a chance, Mr. Somers."&#xD;
&#xD;
"p~a't you think it wonid he a great gratification to all&#xD;
your old friends in Pattaquasset, if YOU would consent to&#xD;
Iill my pulpit next Sunday? They-I believe they'd come&#xD;
from all over the country !-and it would be-..-a----it would&#xD;
be a very great gratification indeed to me. Can't I prevail&#xD;
with you ?"&#xD;
Faith had ceased her work and was standing quite still,&#xD;
with bended head, and cheeks which had gathered their&#xD;
colour into two vivid, spots. On those carnations Mr.&#xD;
Linden's eyes rested for a moment, with a strange feeling&#xD;
of pleasure, of emotion. The sort of touched smile upon&#xD;
his lips when he spoke, did not, it may be said, belong to&#xD;
Mr. Soniers. His answer was very simple and straightfor-&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
"I should like to see and speak to all my old friends&#xD;
again, sir, more than I can tell you-and I think they&#xD;
would be glad to see me. I could do it so well in no other&#xD;
way. Thank you, Mr. Somers !-it is you who confer the&#xD;
"Then you'll do it ?" said Mr. Somers, delighted. "If&#xD;
am very happy-very fortunate indeed! It will be quite a&#xD;
relief. And a pleasure-a very great pleasure-a-I assure&#xD;
you sir. It's profitable for a people to have a change-..&#xD;
they listen-ha !-they hear the same things said in a dif~&#xD;
fervent way ; and it is often striking. And it is certainly&#xD;
profitable to the pa~stor. Well, Mr. Linden, I shall make&#xD;
a great many people happy,.-and Mrs. Somers, she'll set&#xD;
off on her side to tell the news. How long are you going-.-..&#xD;
a-to remain in Pattaquasset ?-But I don't know," added&#xD;
he laughing,-" as I ought to ask !"&#xD;
Faith had carried her spoons summarily to the cup1~&#xD;
board, and was sitting at an open window near it, looking&#xD;
out.&#xD;
"And I cannot answer," said Mr~ Linden. "I have hardly&#xD;
got past my~ arrival yet, sir."&#xD;
"No-certainly. I was-a-premature. You must ex~.&#xD;
cuse me. And I have no right to take up any more of&#xD;
your time,-as you have so kindly-a-consented to give&#xD;
me Sunday. What is the state of religion now, abroad,&#xD;
sir?"&#xD;
The answer to which comprehensive inquiry drew on&#xD;

&#xD;
into atalk of some length, although Mr. Somers had de.&#xD;
dared he must go and had no right to stay. For a little&#xD;
wh~fle Faith sat still by her window, but then she vanished&#xD;
and appeared at Mrs. Derrick's side in the kitchen. The&#xD;
dishes were all done there too, and Mrs. Derrick wag&#xD;
ticking " about,---talking to Faith and wishing Mr. Somers&#xD;
would go, some time before he weuiL Faith heard the&#xD;
closing door, and the light returning step,-then a c1ear~&#xD;
not loud-spoken---" Mignonette-where are you ?"&#xD;
Faith sprang back through the passage, and stood in the&#xD;
eating-room again. Wit a very sweet sort of gravity. All&#xD;
her mind and her face f~l~of the thought that he was going&#xD;
to preach for Mr. Somers.&#xD;
J' What are you about, little Sunbeam ?-are you busy ?"&#xD;
"Then first r want a talk with you, and then a walk&#xD;
with you,--do you want the same with me ?-or are you&#xD;
tired ?"&#xD;
"No-yes ;-I'm not tired a bit."&#xD;
"Are you nervous ?" he said, drawing her off into the&#xD;
next room.&#xD;
"No 1" she said laughing a little ,-"did you ever tl~nk&#xD;
I w~as, Ei~decott ?" - But Faith's heart beat somewhat&#xD;
strangely.&#xD;
"I am going to try you-" he said as he sat d?~wn by&#xD;
her; "so if you are, shut up your eyes."&#xD;
There was no sign of shutting up in Faith's eyes. She&#xD;
00 ed at him, not indeed assuredly, but steadily, and with&#xD;
a wee smile. Eye and smile were met and held, until he&#xD;
had taken her left hand and held that too; but then look-&#xD;
ing down at it, Mr. Linden gravely took out a little gold&#xD;
ring and proceeded to try how well its dimensions agreed&#xD;
with those of the finger for which it was destined.&#xD;
Nothing moved of Faith but her eyes, which followed&#xD;
his, and the fluttering colour-which fluttered indeed! went&#xD;
and came like the lights on a wreath of vapour.&#xD;
Silently the hand, with both rings on, was looked at for&#xD;
a few moments-then held to his lips, with special greeting&#xD;
of those two fingers; and then, as he took off the second&#xD;
ring, Mr. Linden looked up at her.&#xD;
"Mignon9tte, when may I put it on again ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
There seemed to be difficulty in Faith's answering. Pro-&#xD;
bably she was making up her mind to speak, but he had to&#xD;
wait for her words to be ready. He waited quietly, as if&#xD;
he expected it; looking down at the hand he held, and&#xD;
saying nothing unless by the clasp of its little fingers.&#xD;
"Do you know where you are going, yet Endy ?"-she&#xD;
said in a very low voice."&#xD;
"No, darling-not certainly."&#xD;
"Then-do you want to know this yet ?"&#xD;
"Very much."&#xD;
Faith had expected no less; she had had fair warning;&#xD;
and besides in her heart could not but confess that Mr.&#xD;
Linden had reason. Little as she might care to disturb&#xD;
the existing state of things, which to her mind was pleasant&#xD;
enough, it was clear that his mind on the subject was differ-&#xD;
ent; and she could not fijid fault with that. There was a&#xD;
pause again, of quiet waiting on one side and great diffi-&#xD;
culty of utterance on the other, and the words when they&#xD;
came were in the lowest possible key.&#xD;
"What do you wish ?"&#xD;
"What I have been waiting for all these years."&#xD;
"But as to time?"&#xD;
"As little as possible."&#xD;
"I know,-but what is that, Endy ?"-she said with very&#xD;
timid intonation.&#xD;
"'As little as possible' ?" he said, raising his eyes with a&#xD;
laughing look to her face,-" the words hardly need ex-&#xD;
planation-I might have stayed Mr. Somers this afternoon.&#xD;
It cannot be too soon for me, Mignonette-but I do not&#xD;
know what is possible for you."&#xD;
What was possible for her! It almost took Faith's&#xD;
breath away. Because she acknowledged Mr. Linden's&#xD;
right to his wish. She was in great confusion, besides.&#xD;
"I will do what you please !" ~he said at length. "You&#xD;
may arrange it with mother."&#xD;
"No, with you," said Mr. Linden,-" what do you please.?&#xD;
Am I to repeat the passage of Qi~iapaw creek ?"&#xD;
a She looked up and looked at him, and said yes. It was&#xD;
look any man would have liked to have given him., Not&#xD;
without a little fear of what he might say, those eyes put&#xD;
such a pure faith in him and were so ready to answer his&#xD;

not.&#xD;
"You know, dear Faith, I sent you word to be ready for&#xD;
me,-.--is that done ?"&#xD;
"Yes-h-nearly."&#xD;
"'Nearly' is soon dispatched," said Mr. Linden,-" and&#xD;
this is the month when, 'if ever, come perfect days '-Shall&#xD;
we say a week from to-day?"&#xD;
She looked very startled, soft though the glance was that&#xD;
again met his face. And for a moment the roses fairly fled&#xD;
away. "As soon as possible" this was, sure enough. They&#xD;
came back however, first stealthily an4 then swiftly, till&#xD;
Faith's face was bowed and her right hand with futile intent&#xD;
of concealment was interposed between it and Mr. Linden.&#xD;
But whether Faith meant to speak or meant not to speak,&#xD;
certain it is that words were none.&#xD;
"I cannot have this 1" said Mr. Linden, as he took the&#xD;
shielding ~hand into his own possession,.~-" Faith, you. shall&#xD;
not look tale about it. This is the second time I have&#xD;
banished the colour in the first twenty-four hours I have&#xD;
been home. And these roses I see now, seem to* me to&#xD;
come from the same tree as the white ones. If you would&#xD;
look more boldly at the subject it would appear much l'ess&#xD;
terrific-and the same might be said of me. What sort of&#xD;
a face have I down there in the carpet ?"&#xD;
There was a little clasp of his hand which answered that;&#xD;
but though he could see Faith's lips give way he did not&#xD;
hear them speak.&#xD;
"Mignonette, the treaty waits your signature. ~&#xD;
"Yes, Endy,"-she said quaintly enough. Mr. Linden&#xD;
brought her face round within sight, saying-much as he&#xD;
had done at QuaPaw creek-"Are you afraid, dear child ?"&#xD;
"No-" she said timidly, and yet "no"it was.&#xD;
"Then it only needs my seal.-In one of the northern&#xD;
countries of Europe, Mignonette, the bride and bridegroom&#xD;
are expected to stand at the open window for an hour or&#xD;
two, in full dress,-so you see things are not so bad as they&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
T was the pretty time of a summer afternoon. The sun,&#xD;
in the last quarter of almost his longest journey of the&#xD;
year, but high yet, sent warm rays to rest in the meadows&#xD;
and daily with the tree tops and sparkle on the Mong and&#xD;
its salt outlet. The slight rustle of leaves now and then&#xD;
was as often caused by a butterfly or a killdeer as by the&#xD;
breeze; sometimes by a heavy damask rose that suddenly&#xD;
sent down its rosy shower upon~ the ground. It Was the&#xD;
very pastime of birds and insects and roses,-with that&#xD;
slight extra stir which told the time of day and that the&#xD;
afternoon siesta was at an end.&#xD;
Gathering roses as he went along, fastening them in her&#xD;
belt or her bonnet, Mr. Linden led Faith down the farm&#xD;
road by which he had driven her to the shore that first day&#xD;
after her illness. There was small danger of meeting any&#xD;
one,-it was not the time for loads of hay and grain, and&#xD;
little else passed that way: the laborers in the fields were&#xD;
seen and heard only at a distance. Mr. Linden himself&#xD;
was in as gay and gladsome a mood as the day, more&#xD;
lively indeed, and active-taking the "dolce far" ~i~thout&#xD;
the "niente;" witnessing what "the year of exile" had&#xD;
been, by his joy in being at home, with June and Mignon-&#xD;
ette. The ~ talk had added something even Vo&#xD;
both their perfections-he could not forget it though he&#xD;
talked of other things. Neither did Faith forget it. Yet&#xD;
~ she laughed at Mr. Linden and with him; though as far&#xD;
~ as conversation was concerned she took a secondary part.&#xD;
She started no subject whatever, of the least ~moment.&#xD;
Subjects started of themselves-in numbers somewhat like&#xD;
the little butterflies that roused out of the clover as the&#xD;
intruding feet came by,-about as airy, about as flitting,&#xD;
not quite so purposeless. And thus in a way more sum-&#xD;
mery than summary, Mr. Linden and Faith arrived at the&#xD;
~ shore. He found a shady seat for her, and with no "by&#xD;

airy situation on a wild thorn.&#xD;
"Mignon ette, do you know what I mean to do with you&#xD;
after Thursday ?"&#xD;
"No, Endecott."&#xD;
"I shall put you before inc on the wooden horse spok~~&#xD;
of in the fairy tale, turn the pin under his right ear, and&#xD;
be off."&#xD;
"What's that story !".-said Faith, looking round at him&#xD;
(he was standing behind her) with the prettiest of bright&#xD;
flushed faces. /&#xD;
"An authentic account of how a prince carried off a&#xD;
princess."&#xD;
"How did he ?"&#xD;
"Got her consent first-(couldn't get anybody's else, but&#xD;
that did 7 ot matter)-ordered some one to bring the wooden&#xD;
horse to the-front of the palace, placed her and himself as&#xD;
aforesaid, turned the pin, and disappeared from the curious&#xD;
eyes of the whole court. The story goes on to state that&#xD;
they both enjoyed the ride."&#xD;
"Was that what you meant when you asked me if I liked&#xD;
travelling in cars ?-" said Faith, a very little laugh speak-&#xD;
ing her sense of the application.&#xD;
"Quick witted little princess !" said Mr. Linden. "The&#xD;
horse that refuses to carry double for your service, shall be&#xD;
dismissed from mine."&#xD;
"But I don't see much, yet," said Faith. "I don't under-&#xD;
stand the story nor you. I think you have taken me a great&#xD;
many rides on that horse."&#xD;
"Not en princesse" said Mr. Linden smiling. "The&#xD;
story is very simple, my dear. After showing his wife&#xD;
various places of interest, and letting his friends see her,&#xD;
the prince arrives at home. ,It is said that he then finds&#xD;
his fortune-but I think that part of the story is. fabulous,&#xD;
so don't set y&amp;amp;ur heart upon it."&#xD;
"That's the story-but what do you mean, Endy ?"&#xD;
"To give you such a ride. I mean that I am the prince,&#xD;
and that you (will be) the princess, who shall do all these&#xD;
things."&#xD;
Faith jumped up. "Do you 1".-&#xD;
"Truly I do, dear Mignonette."&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.                 413&#xD;
Faith's face was changing. The undoubted joy in her&#xD;
eye had yet a check somewhere.&#xD;
"But Endecott-"&#xD;
"Qu'est ce que c'est, Mademoiselle?"&#xD;
"You haven't a wooden horse !"-she said with a&#xD;
delicious and most delicate mixture of frankness and&#xD;
timidity.&#xD;
"Are you sure of the fact ?-.-and after all, Mademoiselle,&#xD;
what then ?"&#xD;
The same look almost answered him without words. "I&#xD;
am not sure-" she said. "I thought so."&#xD;
"What is the point of the remark ?"&#xD;
She hesitated between the two feelings. But frankness,&#xD;
or duty, carried it. "Because, Endy-if that were so,-~&#xD;
I don't want to go !"&#xD;
"How did your royal pride get turned about ?-..-that you&#xD;
will look at none but a wooden horse ?"&#xD;
She smiled at him, a little puzzled as of old, and not&#xD;
choosing to venture any further.&#xD;
"I suppose I know what you mean, my dear one," Mr.&#xD;
Linden said, taking both her hands in his, and smiling too;&#xD;
"but as I do not intend to be John Gilpin, you need not be&#xD;
his wife,-not yet. Besides, the horse-.--of whatever sort-.&#xD;
will require less than you suppose; and~ for the prince and&#xD;
princess, they,&#xD;
Being in the air,&#xD;
Will not care&#xD;
.How they fare !".~&#xD;
Which words had an overcoming effect not onl~r upon&#xD;
Faith's nascent scruples, but upon Faith herself; and a&#xD;
perfect series of little laughs *of the most musical descrip-&#xD;
tion rolled along a very limited extent of the shore, kept&#xD;
corn pa4by flushing colours as fair as the lights which were&#xD;
just then playing in the clouds overhead. Mr. Linden,&#xD;
holding her hands still, watched his princess with the most&#xD;
j perfect satisfaction.&#xD;
"Is your mind at rest?" he said. "You know I threat.&#xD;
~ ened to keep you all to ni4self for six months-though I'm&#xD;
~ afraid four will be as nearlas I can come to it."&#xD;
"But where are you going, Endy ?"&#xD;

"That waits partly on your choice. In general, to hills,&#xD;
cities, and rivers,-the Falls, the White Mountains, Wash.&#xD;
ington, and the pictured rocks of Lake Superior. Then&#xD;
to some shore where you can see real surf-and to delight&#xD;
the eyes of some of my old friends by the way."&#xD;
Faith's eye went gravely over to the sunny Long Island&#xD;
shore, but her mind had made a perfect leap. The only&#xD;
outward token of which was the unconsciously playing line&#xD;
of her lips. Such a journey ! -with him! rfhe breeze&#xD;
from the White Mountains seemed to blow in her face&#xD;
already, and the capital of the country rose before her in a&#xD;
most luminous cloud-view. With Mr. Linden to guide&#xD;
her and to tell her everything l-She did not see the eyes&#xD;
that were watching her, but when she suddenly noticed the&#xD;
silence and turned towards Mr. Linden, the smile w~ on&#xD;
his lips too.&#xD;
"I thought I should go right to work," she said,&#xD;
"to study-to make up for lost time. Can't I ~do that&#xD;
too?"&#xD;
"As much as you like! But don't you know there is a&#xD;
lost holiday to be made up, as well ?"&#xD;
"It is made up,"-she said gently, after a minute's hesi-&#xD;
tation.&#xD;
"How that grieved me when I went away !" said Mr.&#xD;
Linden,-" to take from you what I might never be able to&#xD;
replace. But sit down, dear child - I want to consult you&#xD;
about various things."&#xD;
Faith sat down and looked-like a grave child ,i~n deed.&#xD;
Her journey for the present forgotten, and all h~r mind&#xD;
bent on something more weighty and worthy.&#xD;
"I told you I had three letters for you to read," said&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "One reached me in Germany, two I found&#xD;
waiting for me here. They are all about the same subject,&#xD;
Mignonette: where you and I shall establish ourselves."&#xD;
A flush rose, but she looked steadily.&#xD;
"lou told me once," Mr. Linden went on, "that in such&#xD;
a case I should choose the place where I was most needed&#xD;
-where there was most work for me to do. Now you&#xD;
shall judge. The pastor of a large 'manufacturing town in&#xD;
Pennsylvania (I may say of the town-it is so in effect) has&#xD;
accepted a call to Baltimore. I knew him formerly, and I&#xD;

suppose it is through his influence that the people have&#xD;
applied to me." Faith thought it very likely.&#xD;
"How large is the town, Endy ?"&#xD;
"Ten or fifteen thousand-I do not know precisely."&#xD;
"And nether churches ?"&#xD;
"Yes, but this is so much the leading one that the others&#xD;
hardly hold their ground; and by the xyay, I think I would&#xD;
rather have a call from one of them. Apparently the&#xD;
churchgoers are in the minority."&#xD;
Faith thought there must be work enough to do in that&#xD;
place; but she only listened more gravely.&#xD;
"An old friend of my father's writes the second letter.&#xD;
He lives at Newport, and has pleased himself with building&#xD;
a new church in a part of the ishind not much adorned with&#xD;
spires. Climate and society are good, scenery picturesque,&#xD;
and he is quite sure if I will only bring-Mrs. Linden !-to&#xD;
his house, she will decide in favour of Newp~6rt at once."&#xD;
Faith's eyes xvent down, and rouge of the richest and&#xD;
frankest coloured her cheeks.&#xD;
"Do you think she will ?" said Mr. Linden demurely.&#xD;
"What is the other, Endy ?-You said three."&#xD;
"The other, love, is from those very White Mountains&#xD;
you are going to see. Another friend writes the letter,-&#xD;
one who has built himself a nest there for summer migra-&#xD;
tions. It is a strange place, Faith, by all accounts-I have&#xD;
never been to that part of the mountains. A scattered&#xD;
population, sprinkled about on the hills like their own dew-&#xD;
berries, and to be found in much the same manner. Neither&#xD;
church~or chapel, but only an unused schoolhouse-of&#xD;
which Mr. Olyphant prays I will come and take possession.&#xD;
Snow and frost, the valleys and the everlasting hills-that&#xD;
would be your society."&#xD;
Faith's eyes were raised now and met Mr. Linden's.&#xD;
Grave, as one who felt the weight of the questiOn to be&#xD;
settled; but with a brow unshadowed, and eyes unfeariifg.&#xD;
A child's look still!&#xD;
"Mr. Olyphant says there could not be better air for my&#xD;
bird to sing in," he went on with a srnile,-"there was one&#xD;
great objection to the place in Pennsylvania. How does&#xD;
this seem to you, dear Faith ?-it is rather on a spur of the&#xD;
mountains-not absolutely shut in. ~Then I am not sure&#xD;

how much society you would have but mine,-what do you&#xD;

She answered at first with a rare little smile, so happy in&#xD;
its grave trust, and which withal a little significantly&#xD;
deferred the question.&#xD;
"1 know you will go where you thi r~k you ought to go.&#xD;
Endy-1 don't know about places." /&#xD;
"I doubt whether I shall grant more than half of Mr.&#xD;
Alcott's request," said Mr. Linden. "I suppose if George&#xD;
has not got home I may venture to grant that. Faith, it&#xD;
is a very singular fact that everybody falls in love with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
To judge by Faith's blush, it was a somewhat painful&#xD;
'fact~.' "Whom are you talking of?" she said doubtfully.&#xD;
"The present occasion of my remark is George Alcott.-.&#xD;
said to be absent on a crusade of search after a pair of eyes&#xD;
he saw in Pattaquasset."&#xD;
"I don't know him," said Faith laughing a little; hut&#xD;
instantly recurring to business she asked very earnestly,&#xD;
"Then, Endy, you think you will go to that place in the&#xD;
mountains ?.-.-or haven't you made up your mind ?"&#xD;
"I am inclined to that one, of the three-I cannot say&#xD;
my mind is absolutely made up. It has had so much else&#xD;
to do since I came home! Faith, do you mean to have any&#xD;
bridesmaids ?"&#xD;
Faith jumped up off her rock. "Endy, I want to rim.&#xD;
down and look at these little fish. And it's growing late,&#xD;
besides !"-&#xD;
"Yes, but, you must answer me first," said Mr. Linden&#xD;
laughing and holding her fast. "It is needful I should&#xD;
know beforehand, because they will want supporters, if I&#xD;
do not."&#xD;
"I don't want any, Endy," said Faith with cheeks like&#xD;
two pink roses, but standing very still now.&#xD;
"Then come and shew me the fish. Don't you t~hi~ik it&#xD;
would be gladsome work to seek out those untaughfl~nd&#xD;
uncared for people up in the mountains ?"&#xD;
They had come down to the rocks between and among&#xD;
which at low tide the shell fish played in an inch or two of&#xD;
water; and sitting on one of the mossy stones Faith was&#xD;
watching the mimic play of evil passions which was going&#xD;

on among that tribe of Mollusca below her; but her mind&#xD;
was on something else.&#xD;
"I read the other day," she said, "those words of Paul,&#xD;
where he says to the Thessalonlails 'we were allowed of God&#xD;
to be put in trust with the gospel'.-They made me very&#xD;
happy.~~they make me happy now.-'What I thought of in&#xD;
connexion with them, I mean."&#xD;
"And what was that ?"&#xD;
"That they are your words too,"-she said after looking&#xD;
up as it~ she thought her meaning must be known~-"And&#xD;
that even I-have something to do," she added lower.&#xD;
Mr. Linden stood by her, looking off at the rippling&#xD;
waves, then down at his fair little helper. "Yes, Faith-&#xD;
it is a glorious thing to have any part of that work in&#xD;
trust,-and the part which makes least show may be no less&#xD;
in reality. 'In trust' 1" he repeated, looking off again.&#xD;
"Such beautiful words !-..-such terrible."&#xD;
"No !".-she said with a smile,-" I don't think so."&#xD;
"Nor I, dear, from your point of view. But in the&#xD;
world, Faith, where you have been so little, I have seen the&#xD;
words of the trust to be boundless-the faithfulness of the&#xD;
trustees within very narrow limits. And to be always&#xD;
ready to 'sow beside all waters'-who is? ' Freely ye have&#xD;
received, freely give', is the command-hut what Christian&#xD;
sees with half perception what he has received !"&#xD;
Faith paused and looked thoughtful, and then smiled&#xD;
ag~iin. "I always think of the words you read to me one&#xD;
day,-' On~ be thou: strong and very courageous,-for the&#xD;
Lord thy od is with thee, whithersoever thou goest'. "-&#xD;
The an 4wering look told that if Mr. Linden's words had&#xD;
not been said for the purpose of drawing her out, they had&#xD;
at least served that purpose.&#xD;
"You are a dear little Sunbeam !" he said. "Acting out&#xD;
your name, as I told you long ago. There is nothing&#xD;
needful to get you ready for the White Mountains but a fur&#xD;
cloak. Now come-it is growing late, as you say.&#xD;
It was a late tea-time when they got home. They sat&#xD;
down to tea and Faith had not told her mother yet! which&#xD;
~&amp;amp; she remembered with a somewhat uneasy mind. There was&#xD;
nothing uneasy about the third member of the family !-the&#xD;
poise and balance of the white strawberries upon each&#xD;

other was not more complete than the resting adjustment&#xD;
of all his thoughts.&#xD;
"Mrs. Derrick," he said as she handed him his cup of&#xD;
tea, "what do you consider the prettiest time of day ?"&#xD;
"The prettiest time of day ?" Mrs. Derrick repeated,...&#xD;
"do you mean when the day looks best-or the people?&#xD;
I'm sure I don't know, Mr. Linden, - I never watch any.&#xD;
body from morning to night but Faith."&#xD;
"I am talking of Faith-or what concerns her."&#xD;
"0 well all times of day are alike to her,7' said hei'&#xD;
mother fondly,-"she's just as pretty one time as another,&#xD;
-and one day as another. Only the days when she used&#xD;
to get letters."&#xD;
"Mignonette," said Mr. Linden, "when should I have&#xD;
heard such a piece of news from you?"&#xD;
"I never knew it before," said Faith.&#xD;
"How many hours does she need for a morning toilette ?"&#xD;
said he, pursuing his researches.&#xD;
"Hours !" said Mrs. Derrick-"you'd better say minutes.&#xD;
It's less than an hour, commonly."&#xD;
"But I mean uncommonly."&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick looked thoroughly puzzled. But Faith&#xD;
had go~ the key, and hopeless of stopping Mr. Linden she&#xD;
thought the next best thing was to expedite matters.&#xD;
"When I take longest, mother,"-she suggested in a low&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"How long would she need to arrange orange flowers to&#xD;
her satisfaction-" said Mr. Linden,-" or white muslin ?"&#xD;
"0 !-" said Mrs. Derrick setting down the teapot with&#xD;
her cup half filled. "I didn't know what you were talking&#xD;
about."&#xD;
"I am talking about next Thursday," said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
with a gay gentleness of manner. "Because we have de-&#xD;
cide&amp;amp;-or I have-that Thursday is to be the prettiest day&#xD;
of the week, and now we want to choose the prettiest time&#xD;
of day.''&#xD;
A little flush came into Mrs. Derrick's quiet face,-she&#xD;
said not a word.&#xD;
"You are willing it should be then ?" Mr. Linden said.&#xD;
The mother's "yes" was very firm and clear, and yet&#xD;
&#xD;
not in just her usual tone. That came back a minute after&#xD;
with the relief which a thought of business always brings.&#xD;
"That dress isn't made !" she said. Mr. Linden's&#xD;
"Faith !-" was expressive.&#xD;
"I knew that it could be done in a day at any time,&#xD;
Thidecott," - said Faith, very grave and flushed. "It is&#xD;
up stairs in my drawer, mother."&#xD;
"Kept there by what piece of superstition ?" he said&#xD;
smiling. "Did (~you think if you made it up that I would&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
RIDAY passed all too swiftly. Not in much ww'1e~so&#xD;
F far as Faith was concerned-unless so far as Mr. Un.&#xD;
den gave her work. Apparently she had been out of his&#xD;
sight long enough-he was not in the mood to let her be&#xD;
so any more. Saturday followed close in Friday's steps&#xD;
until after dinner, then came a move., For Pet and Thu.&#xD;
hen were to come in the afternoon ti'ain; and Mr. Linden&#xD;
going with Jerry to the station to meet them, summoned&#xD;
Faith to give "her sweet company."&#xD;
So far as the station, Faith gave it; but there she drew&#xD;
back into the furthest corner of the wagon, and waited,&#xD;
while Mr. Linden walked up and down betweenn th wagon&#xD;
and the front platform. Waited, and watched ,fiWtively,&#xD;
everything; him and the people that spoke to him; with&#xD;
those strange eyes that saw everything new. Then came&#xD;
the whistle! the rush and roar of the train-the moment's&#xD;
lull; and then Faith saw the three she looked for coming&#xD;
towards her. Reuben a little in advance with Miss Linden's&#xD;
travelling bag, she with one hand on her brother's shoulder&#xD;
and her eyes on his face, coming rather slowly after,-talk.&#xD;
lug, asking questions, some of~ which Faith could almost&#xD;
guess from the look and smile with which they were an-&#xD;
swered. It was a pretty picture; she felt as if she knew&#xD;
them both better for seeing it. Before they had quite&#xD;
reached the wagon, Pet received an answer which made her&#xD;
quit Mr. Linden with a little spring and leave him to follow&#xD;
with Reuben. And Faith had opened the wagon door.&#xD;
"Faith! you dear child !" said Miss Linden, "what have&#xD;
you been doing with yourself-or what has anybody done&#xD;
with you, to stow you away here like a forgotten parcel ?"&#xD;
She had entered the wagon no further than to rest one&#xD;
knee there holding both Faith's hands and looking at her&#xD;
with full, bright, loving eyes. "How came Endecott to&#xD;
leave you here, alone ?"&#xD;
"Two people must be alone-if they are not together,"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden. "Pet, shall I put you in or out ?"&#xD;
(420)&#xD;
&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.              ~ 421&#xD;
She laughed, jumping into the wagon then and ~w~i~iii~&#xD;
otie arm about Faith's waist, much like a spray of w6~d~*"'&#xD;
birfe.&#xD;
"What do you think I have asked him ?" she whispered,&#xD;
,-"and what do you think he has told me ?"&#xD;
"I don't know," said Faith ;-"but I guess."&#xD;
A significant clasp of the woodhine answered that-~-then&#xD;
the hand rested in a quiet embrace.&#xD;
"How well he looks !" she said, her eyes taking glad&#xD;
note of one figure on the seat before them. "Faith, how&#xD;
are you ?"&#xD;
"I am well. "-Nothing eduld be quieter in its kind.&#xD;
"Did he tell you what he is going to do to-morrow, Pet ?"&#xD;
"No-" she said looking her quick inquiry. Faith's&#xD;
face might have told her before she spoke; such a joy sat&#xD;
gravely on her brow and in the depth of her eyes.&#xD;
"If you go to church tomorrow, you will know."&#xD;
A sudden flush, both of cheeks and eyes, bore witness to&#xD;
the interest of this news. The look met Faith's for a mo-&#xD;
ment-then rested on. Mr. Linden, and then with that little&#xD;
tide of feeling deepening its sweet flow, the eyes fell, the&#xD;
unbent lips wavered and trembled. Faith ventured only a&#xD;
~ silent act of free-masonry ; a fast clasp of her fingers round&#xD;
~ Miss Linden's hand that rested on her waist; but maybe&#xD;
~i nc~er yet in their short friendship had they felt their hearts&#xD;
beat so close together. With one, there was perhaps some&#xD;
; old recollection or association--some memory of the time&#xD;
~ when such a day had been first talked of, that made self-&#xD;
~ command a hard matter; for though the lips presently grew&#xD;
still, and the eyes quiet, jhe gravity that remained was easily&#xD;
~ stirred, and the voice spoke doubtfully.&#xD;
There was more discussion of various things that evening&#xD;
~ than Faith cared for, but it could not be helped. Sunday&#xD;
~ brought a lull of discussions. But the gravity which sat&#xD;
~ on Faith's face that morning was not the less but the&#xD;
more. If a guardian angel had. shewn himself bodily, his&#xD;
face might have worn such a pure distance from low and&#xD;
trifling things and like kindred with the blue sky and the&#xD;
truth it emblematizes. That day was the first of her new&#xD;
life to Faith. Not such to Mr. Linden; but it was the&#xD;
first of her seeing him publicly take the office to which )~i8&#xD;

&#xD;
life was to be gwen, and in which hers was to be by hi~&#xD;
side. She was a very grave "sunbeam" when she set out&#xD;
to walk to church-and as clear!&#xD;
There were sunbeams in plenty of the literal kind abroad;&#xD;
it was a perfect day; and everybody was glad of that, though&#xD;
some people remarked it would have made no difference if&#xD;
it had rained cannon-balls. Never did Pattaquasset see&#xD;
such a coming to church! never in the rememb z~ance of&#xD;
Mr. Somers. They came from all over; the cou1~ry was&#xD;
gleaned; and many a fire was raked up on the hearthstone&#xD;
that day which most Sundays got leave to burn and some-&#xD;
body to watch it. The fishermen came from Quapaw, and&#xD;
the laborers from the farms all over the country; those&#xD;
who did not directly know Mr. Linden, knew of, him; and&#xD;
knew such things of him that they would jiot have missed&#xD;
this opportunity of hearing him speak, for a week's wages.&#xD;
The fathers and mothers of the boys he had taught, they&#xD;
knew him; and they came in mass, with all their uncles,&#xD;
aunts and cousins to the remotest degree, provided they&#xD;
were not geographically too remote. The upper society&#xD;
of Pattaquasset lost not a man nor a woman; they were&#xD;
all there, some with great love, others with great curiosity.&#xD;
The Stoutenburghs had plumed themselves. Mr. Simlins&#xD;
was as upright as his new beaver. Miss Essie Do Staff&#xD;
with magnified black eyes; Judge Harrison with benevo-&#xD;
lent anticipation~ Mr. Stephens the fisherman had driven&#xD;
his little lame child down to the Pattaquasset church, "for&#xD;
once ;" Jonathan Ling was there with his wife, having left&#xD;
the eldest child to keep house, and both being in great&#xD;
smartness and expectation. Jonathan Fax was there and&#xD;
his new wife; the one with a very grave head, the other&#xD;
with a very light one, and faces accordingly. Mrs. derrick&#xD;
and Pet had long ago been quIetly seated; when through&#xD;
that full house,, after her Sunday school duth~s were over,&#xD;
Faith came inK Her colour was very bright, and she trem-&#xD;
bled; but it was not because m~ny saw in her an object of&#xD;
curiosity; though Faith rememI~ered it, at that minut~l she&#xD;
did not care. '$he felt the stillness of expectation that&#xD;
filled the house, with which the little murmur of sound now&#xD;
and then chimed so well; the patter of childish feat that&#xD;
followed her up the aisle spoke so keenly to her wrought&#xD;
&#xD;
up feeling of the other one of her class, who used to follow&#xD;
him with such delight; that Faith felt as if the happy little&#xD;
spirit long since received in at the golden gates, was even&#xD;
there in the church, to hear once more his beloved teacher.&#xD;
Who else ?.-what other angel wings stirred in the soft&#xD;
breeze that floated through from door to door ?-what&#xD;
other unseen, immortal senses waited on those dear mortal&#xD;
lips ?-Faith's step grew lighter, her breath more hushed*&#xD;
eyes might look at her-she looked not at them.&#xD;
And eyes did look, from all sorts of motives; perhaps in&#xD;
the whole church there was not a person who did not try&#xD;
to see her, except the one who next to herself was the most&#xD;
interested-Pet never moved. Her head was bent, her&#xD;
hand half supporting half concealing in its position, like any&#xD;
statue she sat there, nor even stirred when the stir of every&#xD;
one else told who had come in. If she held her, breath to&#xD;
hear every one of her brother's steps as he passed by, she&#xD;
did not look at him; did not raise her head till his first&#xD;
prayer was ended; then her rapt gaze wa~ as unwavering.&#xD;
The service which followed could not be measured bythe&#xD;
ordinary line and rule of pulpit eloquence and power,-&#xD;
could not' be described by most of the words which buzz&#xD;
down the aisles after a popular sermon. There was not&#xD;
the "newness of hand" of a young preacher-for almost&#xD;
from boyhood Mr. Linden had been about his Master's&#xD;
work. To him it was as simple a thing to deliver his mes-&#xD;
sage to many as to one,-many, many of those before him&#xD;
had known his private ministrations~ and not a few had&#xD;
through them first known the truth; and now to all these&#xD;
assembled faces he was just what each had seen him alone;&#xD;
as humble, as earnest, as affectionate, as simply speaking&#xD;
not his own words,-for "Who hath made man's mouth-&#xD;
have not I, the Lord ?" No ~ne who heard the ambassador&#xD;
that day, doubted from what court he had received his cre~&#xD;
denials. "In trust with the gospel 1" Yes, it was that; but&#xD;
that with a warm love for the truth and the people that&#xD;
almost outran the trust. As the traveller in the fountain&#xD;
shade of the desert calls to the caravan that passes by&#xD;
through the sand, - as one of the twelve of old, when&#xD;
Christ "blessed and brake and gave to his disciples, and&#xD;

&#xD;
the dkciples to the multitude"; so did he speak from the&#xD;
words-&#xD;
"Eat, 0 friends! drink? yea drink abundantly, 0 be.&#xD;

There were some there ~ho would never forget that day.&#xD;
There were many to whom it eemed, that not the warm&#xD;
summer breeze that floated in ~as gentler or sweeter than&#xD;
the feeling that filled the place. The little lame girl, and&#xD;
her older and rougher father and mother, listened alike to&#xD;
their dear friend with moveless eyes; and drank such a&#xD;
draught of those sweet waters as it was long, long since&#xD;
either of them had tasted in a church. It was a white day&#xD;
for all the fishing population; and nothing would have&#xD;
kept them from coming 'in the afternoon. Miss Essie's&#xD;
black eyes lost all their fire. Farmer Simlins, unknown to&#xD;
himself, sat and smiled. And the one who listened most&#xD;
tenderly and joyfully, listened indeed quietly to the last&#xD;
word, or till her face had leave to bow itself from sight;&#xD;
quietly then no longer, only that such tears come from no&#xD;
broken-up fountains of unrest. They came freely, as Faith&#xD;
recalled and applied the whole of her quoted sentence of&#xD;
Paul to the Thessalonians-&#xD;
"For as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with&#xD;
the gospel, SO WE SPEAK."&#xD;
She was very quiet when the benediction was spoken, but&#xD;
she drew her veil closely as they left the church.&#xD;
It was a lingering getting out, even for them, because&#xD;
others would linger. Some turned to look, some stopped&#xD;
to speak; and if Mi'. Linden had had twenty hands they&#xD;
would all have found employment. Part of this the two&#xD;
veiled figures saw as they made their way to the door, and&#xD;
there Miss Linden paused and looked back. The broad&#xD;
stream of sunlight that lay across the church, the shadowy&#xD;
background figures,.-in that very spot of light, Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den,-made a never-to-be-forgotten picture. Reuben Tay~&#xD;
br stood close behind him, a step back, looking down; little&#xD;
]~Thcy Stephens perched up on the pew cushions had one&#xD;
hand; Robbie Waters-.far dpwn below-the other. Phil&#xD;
Davids and his father, SquiYe Stoiitenburgh, and some of&#xD;
-the Quapaw fishermen made up the group. Pet gave one&#xD;
look, and then she went swiftly down the steps and on.&#xD;
&#xD;
86*&#xD;
&#xD;
Slow the people scattered away, up and down the road;&#xD;
not with the brisk steps and busy voices that give token the&#xD;
church service has but interrupted-.not suspended-the&#xD;
current of everyday thought and behaviour. It was a fair&#xD;
picture of a Sunday i~i a New England village; the abso-&#xD;
lute repose of nature copied' and followed by hands that&#xD;
other days let nothing stand still. Before Faith and Pet&#xD;
got home the road was almost empty. Mr. Linden had&#xD;
overtaken them, but all his greeting was to put Faith's&#xD;
hand on his arm.-then he walked as silent as they. it was&#xD;
a little thing, and yet it touched the 'very feeling she had&#xD;
had all day-the beginning of her new way of life, with&#xD;
him.&#xD;
The afternoon was like the moiming. Not a creature&#xD;
was missing of all who from far and near had filled the&#xD;
house in the former part of the day! and doubtless it was&#xD;
well that Mr. Somers could not hear the spoken and un-&#xD;
spoken wishes that would have unseated him and caused&#xD;
him to relinquish for ever his charge in Pattaquasset.&#xD;
4 The afternoon air was enticing, the afternoon walk home&#xD;
very lingering; then standing in the hall to look and taste&#xD;
~ it still, the sweet peace of everything seemed to enter every&#xD;
~ heart. Even Pet, who all day had been unheard and almost&#xD;
unseen, stood with clasped hands looking out; and only the&#xD;
heavy eyes spoke of the oppression that had been. But as&#xD;
she looked the tears came back again, and then she turned"&#xD;
to Mr. Linden-wrapping her arms round his neck.&#xD;
"Endy, Endy I-do you remember the first time we talked&#xD;
of~this day?"&#xD;
Mr. Linden gave back her caresses without a word, but&#xD;
,~ with a look of pain that Faith had rarely seen on his face.&#xD;
It was some minutes before he spoke. "Dear Pet-she&#xD;
knows it now!"&#xD;
Miss Linden looked up then, mastering her tears, and&#xD;
with a broken "Forgive ixe, Endy-." she kissed him and&#xD;
went away up stairs. But Mr. Linden did not look out&#xD;
any more. He went into the sitting-room7 and resting his&#xD;
face on his hand sat there alone and still, until Faith came&#xD;
to call him to tea.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVIII.&#xD;
J~OW my two pets," said Mr. Linden as they left the&#xD;
table Monday morning, "what are you going&#xD;
to do?"&#xD;
"I am going to work," said his sister. "Mrs. Derrick and&#xD;
I have business on hand. You can have Faith."&#xD;
"There is an impression of that sort on my own mind."&#xD;
"But II mean to-day. Except for about five minutes&#xD;
every half hour."&#xD;
"It would be needless for me to say what I am going to&#xD;
do," observed Faith quietly.&#xD;
"If that is a little piece of self assertion," said Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den, "allow me respectfully to remark that my 'impression'&#xD;
had no reference to the present time. Do you feel molli-&#xD;
fied?"&#xD;
"No," said Faith laughing. "You are wide' of the&#xD;
mark."&#xD;
"Then will you please to state your intentions ?-So far&#xD;
from being needless, it will be what Mr. Somers would call&#xD;
'gratifying."'&#xD;
"I don't know," said Faith merrily. "I understand that;&#xD;
if I tell you, you will say I have no time for them I"-.&#xD;
"For them !-enigmatical. Who told you what I would&#xD;
say ?-Ask me." But Faith laughed.&#xD;
"I am going to make Pet and you some waffles for tea."&#xD;
"Do they require more time than shortcakes ?~'&#xD;
Faith stood before him quietly as if she had a great deal&#xD;
to say. "I am going to make bread, for mother and all&#xD;
of us."&#xD;
"What else ?"&#xD;
"Sponge cake, I think."&#xD;
"And after that ?"&#xD;
"Crust for pot-pie."&#xD;
"De plus?"&#xD;
"Curds,"-said Faith, looking down now.&#xD;
(426)&#xD;
&#xD;
"PourquOi, Mademoiselle ?"&#xD;
"To eat, said Faith demurely. "You like them."&#xD;
"Mademoiselle, I prefer you."&#xD;
"Each in its way,"-replied Faith admirably well, but&#xD;
with a glance, nevertheless.&#xD;
"There is only one in my way," said Mr. Linden. "Well&#xD;
does that complete the circuit ?-I suppose nothing need go&#xD;
between cheese and bread but waffles ?"&#xD;
"I shall wish-.and I suppose you would wish that I&#xD;
should, look over straxvberries."&#xD;
"Where do you commonly do all these things ?"'&#xD;
"The sponge cake and the strawberries in the other&#xD;
room-other things, in the kitchen."&#xD;
j. "We may as well begin as we are to go on 1" said Mr.&#xD;
c~ Linden. "If you will not come and keep me company&#xD;
~ I must do that for you. Faith, I think Miss 'Essie's state~&#xD;
ment of fasts was much like the artistic representation&#xD;
of lions and men, in the fable !"&#xD;
7 Faith did tiot at all dislike this compounding of matters;&#xD;
'~ and so the' strawberries were looked over, and the sponge&#xD;
~ cake beaten in the dining-room; with various social enliven-&#xD;
'1 ings. For besides Mr. Linden's calls upon her attention,&#xD;
I and the subjects by him presented to be looked over along&#xD;
; with the, strawberries, Faith made now and then a run into&#xD;
4 the kitchen to see Mrs. Derrick oriCindy there; and if the&#xD;
runs up stairs were less frequent, they took more time. For&#xD;
Miss Bezac had arrived, , and she and Miss Linden were&#xD;
deep in the white folds of Faith's muslin dress. There too&#xD;
was Mrs. Derrick, for the touch and the making of that&#xD;
dress stirred her very heart. Faith was often in demand,-&#xD;
~ not to use her needle, but her taste-or to be fitted, or 'tried&#xD;
on,' as Miss Bezac said.&#xD;
Coming back' from one of these "trying" visits to the&#xD;
three workers, Faith found Mr. Linden by the sitting-room&#xD;
table; before him a package, in his hands a letter.&#xD;
"Faith," he said, "come and look at this." Faith ran in&#xD;
from the strawberries.&#xD;
"Rosy fingers are not needed," said Mr. Linden, "but as&#xD;
eyes are first called for they may pass. Sit down here by&#xD;
me, Mignonette, and take off this wrapping paper."&#xD;
Which very curiously and amusedly, and now with a little&#xD;
&#xD;

suspicious tinge in her cheeks, Faith did; remarking that&#xD;
she could not help her fingers being rosy.&#xD;
"Keep the roses to their chosen location," said Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den gravely, as the first paper parted right ~nd left and&#xD;
showed a second, which b0re this inscription.-~' For Mrs.&#xD;
Endccott Linden.-with the warmest regards and respects&#xD;
of W. and L. Olyph ant." Faith suddenly jumped up, pushed&#xD;
back her chaii' and whisked back to the strawberries, where&#xD;
she was found diligently putting the hulls into a dish by&#xD;
themselves.&#xD;
"Mignonette, y'bur fingers will be more rosy than ever."&#xD;
Mr. Linden spoke from the doorway where he stood watch.&#xD;
~ng her. Then coming forward he laid a key on the table,&#xD;
" That belongs to you.~~&#xD;
4      "Wouldn't you be so good as to take care of it?  You&#xD;
see I am busy."&#xD;
No my dear, I will not be so good. You shall have&#xD;
that pleasure--as a reward for running away. Would you&#xD;
like to hear this letter ?"&#xD;
"If you please-" Faith said with a little hesitation.&#xD;
"You shall read it to yourself if you like better-" but&#xD;
he read it to her, a~ter all. It was a pretty letter, showing&#xD;
so well Mr. Linden's place in the writer's affection that&#xD;
Faith could not but enjoy it. Neither could she dislike the&#xD;
messages to herself though they did cost her a few roses.&#xD;
As to the contents of the package the letter gave no hint.&#xD;
"What is that the key of; Eudy ?" she said, glancing up&#xD;
after the letter was finished.&#xD;
"I don't know !"-Faith went on with her strawberries.&#xD;
Through the open hail door came little uneven steps,&#xD;
tracking on through other open doors even to the dining~&#xD;
room,-there the steps and Charles twelfth came to a pause.&#xD;
"Ma said," he began,-then fixed his eyes and mind on&#xD;
Mr. Linden with a concentration that was marvellous. The&#xD;
general attire and appearance of the little potentate were&#xD;
as usual, but both hands were in use to support a heavy&#xD;
mass of red coral, hugged up to his blue apron in the most&#xD;
affectionate manner. With a sigh of relief Charles twelfth&#xD;
withdrew his attention from Mr. Linden long enough to set&#xD;
the coral on the floor th&#xD;
behind him.         ,   en gazed anew, with his hands&#xD;
&#xD;
:~jii,~&#xD;
&#xD;
"Charley !" said Faith laughing,.-" what are you doing!&#xD;
...~-and what have you done ?"&#xD;
"1~Ia said-" began the child, stopping short as before.&#xD;
"Charles twelfth," said Mr. Linden holding out his hand&#xD;
"do you never use anything but your eyes? Come here and&#xD;
speak to me. Who is prime minister now&#xD;
"You,".-was the very prompt reply. "Ma said so yes-&#xD;
terday."&#xD;
The laugh in Mr. Linden's eyes as he loQked at Faith,&#xD;
was a thing to see. "Faith," he said, "the conversation&#xD;
I is in your hands !"&#xD;
Faith was in doubtful readiness to speak. "Charley !"-..&#xD;
I she ~said as soon as she could,-" come here. Was that all&#xD;
your ma said r"&#xD;
'~ No," said the boy, "she said a heap more."&#xD;
"Well what did you come here for to..day ?"&#xD;
"I cai~ne to fetch that.-" said Charles twelfth with&#xD;
I another sigh.&#xD;
"Poor child !-What did you bring it for, Charley ?"&#xD;
"Why for you," said Charley. "Ma said she didn't know&#xD;
when it oughter come.- and she guessed you'd like it,&#xD;
'cause it used to live off in the, place where you said they&#xD;
eat up babies and people !" and Charles twelfth's eyes grew&#xD;
large and round with the announcement. "And ma said&#xD;
she's sorry 'twarnt more. I aint."&#xD;
Faith's eyes went to Mr. Linden with a flash and a burst of&#xD;
the uncontrollable littlelaugh; but after that they were sus-&#xD;
piciously downcast, and Faith busied herself in providing&#xD;
little Charles twelfth with the refreshment of a good saucer&#xD;
of sugared strawberries, with which he sat down in a cor-&#xD;
ner much consoled. And when he was setting off again,&#xD;
Faith gave him a whispered message to ask his mother to&#xD;
come and see her Thursday. Just what Mr. Linden saw&#xD;
in the piece of red coral he did not declare, but when&#xD;
Faith came back to the table he was looking at it very&#xD;
fixedly.&#xD;
"Paith," he said, that is not the worst token, nor the&#xD;
worst envoy-that might be. What a shy child you were&#xD;
that first time I took you down there! And you have not&#xD;
changed any too ~nuch," he added, carrying her off to the&#xD;

other room. "I am not sure that you ought to be indulged&#xD;
-suppose you open this box."&#xD;
"You do it, please, Endecott !"-she said with a crimson&#xD;
rush to her cheeks.&#xD;
"I do not believe there is any explosive material under&#xD;
such an address? -however, if there is I prefer that my&#xD;
hands should fire the train. Stand back? Faith !"-and with&#xD;
cautious and la~t ghing deliberation the key was turned and&#xD;
the lid raised. It was a very plain lid, by the way-mere&#xD;
white pine.&#xD;
"There is nothing here. (that appears) but silk paper and&#xD;
cotton, - not gun cotton, probably," said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
"Faith, do you wish me to risk my safety any further ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"My dear, you must have more courage. If I am to&#xD;
open all your boxes I shall have my hands full, and-ne&#xD;
vous en deplaise-J would ~rather see the work in yours."&#xD;
And she was seated before the portentous pine box, Mr.&#xD;
Linden keeping his stand at her side. Faith blushed and&#xD;
didn't like it; but applied her fingers with a sort of fear.&#xD;
ful delicacy to the silk paper and cotton, removing one after&#xD;
the other.&#xD;
The box had interior divisions, by way of help to the&#xD;
silk paper, its different contents being thus more securely&#xD;
separated. Faith's fingers exploring among the papers&#xD;
brought out first a silver chocolate pot, then the dainty&#xD;
china cups for the same, then the spoons, in size and shape&#xD;
just suiting the cups. Spoons and chocolati~re were marked&#xD;
with the right initials; the cups-chocolate colour them.&#xD;
selves, that no drop of the dark beverage might hurt their&#xD;
beauty-had each a delicate gilt F. L. twining about the&#xD;
handle.&#xD;
If the givers could have seen the gift uncovered and in.&#xD;
specter !-the rosy delight in Faith's cheeks, the pleasure&#xD;
in her eye! They would have considered themselves re&#xD;
warded. She looked and bent over the pretty things, her&#xD;
attitude and blush half veiling her admiration and satisfac~&#xD;
tion, but there was no veiling them when she looked up at&#xD;
Mr. Linden. "I am so glad you like chocolate !".-she said&#xD;
naively. But it was worth a hundred remarks of ~stlietie&#xD;
criticism.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am so glad I do !" he said, stooping to kiss her.&#xD;
"Faith, one would almost imagine some bird of the air had&#xD;
told them our chocolate associations."&#xD;
"Now won't you put these back for me ?" said Faith,-&#xD;
"because, if that sponge cake is to get done to-day I&#xD;
haven't two minutes to lose !"&#xD;
The pretty choco1ati~re was but the beginning, as Faith&#xD;
soon found. ~~iiii~d to her most utter and unbounded&#xD;
astonishment-though to that of no one else.&#xD;
Tuesday arrived a packet from Madame Danforth, accoin~&#xD;
panied by a note of affection and congratulation. The&#xD;
present was peculiar. A. satin sachet, embroidered after&#xD;
the little Frenchwoman's desire, and to do it justice very&#xD;
exquisitely scented, was the first thing. A set of window&#xD;
curtains and toilet cover, of a curious and elaborate pattern&#xD;
of netting, made of very fine thread,- a manufacture in&#xD;
which Madame Danforth delightedd and on which she prided&#xD;
herself-was the second thing. The third was a pretty&#xD;
breakfast service of French china.&#xD;
Faith enjoyed them all, with some amusement and some&#xD;
pleasure of possession, and not a little affectionate remem-&#xD;
brance. Even the sachet, in this view, was particularly pre-&#xD;
cious; tha the only use Faith saw in it. But the next&#xD;
arrival gave great start.&#xD;
It was ag t is ime a deal box, but immensely heavy;&#xD;
and it was a strong box that Faith did not attempt to open;&#xD;
marked only 'Grover &amp;amp; Baker', which told her nothing.&#xD;
There was no occasion indeed. A note was delivered with&#xD;
the box, and a small covered basket. The note conveyed&#xD;
the assurance of Sophy Harrison's love and a request that&#xD;
Faith would let her shew it on the present occasion. It&#xD;
went on.-~.&#xD;
"Papa has sent you, dear Faith, an odd thing for a pre-&#xD;
sent-for such a present-but I haven't been able to put it&#xD;
out of his head. lie insists it is what you ought to have,&#xD;
and that he shall have the pleasure of giving it to you.&#xD;
To save you the trouble of opening the box before you&#xD;
want it, I will state that it contains a sewing machine.&#xD;
Papa has taken great pains to satisfy himself-and it&#xD;
is certainly the best or one of the best. My o~ering,&#xD;

Ill&#xD;
&#xD;
dear Faith, is in the basket, and may be looked at with lesg +&#xD;

Miss Sophy's offering was a kindly one. She had sent9,&#xD;
little invoice of silver spoons and forks. Faith was&#xD;
pleased; and yet she looked grave, and very grave, Over~ &#xD;
these things. She made no remark whatever to say&#xD;
why.&#xD;
If no one else knew there was to be a wedding, at least&#xD;
the express man did! and probably in his mind joined I&#xD;
these new packages with those he had so often brought&#xD;
before, very comfortably. The next arrival was a delicate&#xD;
pair of silver salt-cellars and spoons from Mr. Alcott,-then&#xD;
a little framed sketch from the Captain of the Vulcan, por.&#xD;
trying the meeting of two steamers at sea, with these words ~&#xD;
underneath-' The dispatch post'. At which Mr. Linden&#xD;
looked with much amusement. Faith was delighted.&#xD;
First on Wednesday morning came Miss Bezac,--bring~ ~&#xD;
ing the well assorted tokens of an elaborate needlebook&#xD;
and a simple bread trencher and knife; and staying only ~&#xD;
long enough to say, "You see, Faith, what made me think&#xD;
of this, 0was that the first time I heard of that, was when&#xD;
you came in for bread and milk. And now you'll have t~ 4&#xD;
think of me, whether yoa sew or eat !"-with which tri- &#xD;
umphant sentiment Miss Bezac departed.&#xD;
They say ill news flies fast,-in this case so did the good:&#xD;
certainly people are quick to hear an4 understand what ~I&#xD;
pleases them. The friends who had heard from Pet or&#xD;
Mrs. Iredell what was to be, had spread' the information:&#xD;
and in the same sort of way, from two or three old family &#xD;
dependents another class of Mr. Linden's friends had heard&#xD;
it. Perhaps among all her presents the little tokens from ~&#xD;
these people touched her most. They came queerly done&#xD;
up and directed, sometimes the more formal 'Mrs. Linden' ~,,&#xD;
changed into an ill-spelled 'For Mr. lJindecott's wife'-or ~$&#xD;
'For the young lady, in care of Mr. Linden'. She knew ~&#xD;
the name~ thereto appended as little as they knew hers,-&#xD;
could only guess the ,--.the tokens were various.&#xD;
A pair of elaborately carved brackets, a delicate rustic&#xD;
footstool, trimmed with acorns and cones, -a wooden screw&#xD;
pincushion, with a flaming red velvet top, -a case of&#xD;
scissors, pretty enough to have come from anybody, declared&#xD;
&#xD;
the trade of the sender by the black finger marks on the&#xD;
brown wrapper, and a most mysteriously compiled address.&#xD;
One~ of the old sailors who had crossed with Mr. LindeR&#xD;
long ago, sent by Pet's hands a stuffed tropical bird of gor-&#xD;
geous colours; a woman who had once been upper servant&#xD;
in his mother's house, sent by the sa~me messenger a white&#xD;
toilet cushion, made exactly after one that had belonged to&#xD;
her mistress and which she had been allowed to keep. It&#xD;
was worth while to see Mr. Linden examine these things,-&#xD;
every name was familiar to him, every one called up some&#xD;
story or recollection. Alternating with these, came richer&#xD;
presents,-books and vases and silver; then from the poor&#xD;
people in and about Pattaquasset, a couple of corn hllsk&#xD;
mats, a nest of osier baskets. The children brought wild&#xD;
flowers and wild strawberries, the fishermen brought fish,&#xD;
till Mrs. Derrick said, "Child, we might as well begin to~&#xD;
lay down for winter I"&#xD;
Ency Stephens, having got Reuben to bring her two fine&#xD;
long razor shells, had transformed them into a pincushion.&#xD;
This she sent, with a kiss, by Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"I half promised her that she might come before the rest&#xD;
of the world to-morrow, Faith," he said. "She nevert~aw&#xD;
any one married, and has the greatest desire to see you&#xD;
-and I said if you were willing, Reuben should bring her&#xD;
here at one o'clock." Faith was just then exploring the&#xD;
* contents of a new package-or rather two: one of as many&#xD;
spools of white thread as she had scholars in her little&#xD;
class, presentedd by Robbie Waters) the other a wee far-&#xD;
sent carved box of curled maple. She looked up with&#xD;
wet eyes.&#xD;
"Oh let her come, Endecott-I should like to have her&#xD;
here."&#xD;
Faith had been living in a strange atmosphere this week.&#xD;
The first presents that came simply pleased and amused her&#xD;
to a great degree; Judge Harrison's and his daughter's she&#xD;
saw with a strong admixture of painful feeling. But as&#xD;
tokens from rich and poor began to throng in-not of re-&#xD;
spect for her wedding-day so much as of respect and love&#xD;
for Mr. Linden, -Faith's mood grew very tender and&#xD;
touched. Never perhaps, since the world stood, did any-&#xD;
body receive wedding presents from friends known and Un-&#xD;

&#xD;
known with ~ more gentle and humble heart-return to the&#xD;
senders. There was no least thing of them all that Faith&#xD;
did not dearly value; it told her of something so much&#xD;
better than the gifts, and it signified of a link that bound&#xD;
her with that. How beautiful to her eyes the meanest of&#xD;
all those trifles did seem! and for the rest, sh~ was as&#xD;
quick to be delighted with what was really beautiful and&#xD;
glad of what would be really useful, as any sensible child&#xD;
could have been. So the amusement with which the week&#xD;
began changed into a grave, loving, and somewhat timid&#xD;
appreciation of each new arrival.&#xD;
Meanwhile, on Faith's table stood a little silver saucepan&#xD;
..-.sent by Mrs. Somers with the sage remark that she would&#xD;
want it for others if not for herself; and near by, a beauty.&#xD;
ful butter cup and knife from Mrs. Stoutenburgh. With the&#xD;
butter cup trotted down a little mountain pony, with the&#xD;
daintiest saddle and bridle that the Squire could find for&#xD;
money.&#xD;
Miss Linden's love had chosen for itself sundry channels;&#xD;
from the silver knives of all sorts - which made their&#xD;
appearance now, to various comforts, great and small,&#xD;
which were to await her brother and sister in their new&#xD;
home. In those Mrs. Iredell too had a share; her present&#xD;
token was a silver tea-service, whereon the chasing devel.&#xD;
oped itself in sprays of mignonette. A mark of attention&#xD;
which Mr. Linden at least appreciated.&#xD;
&#xD;
CIIAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
IT was very early indeed in the still sweet morning of&#xD;
I Thursday, when Faith threw open the windows and&#xD;
blinds of the sitting-room. No one was abroad, and not&#xD;
even a wind moving. The leaves of the trees hung mo.-&#xD;
tionless; except where a bird stirred them; the dawn was&#xD;
growing slowly into day; sweet odours called forth by the&#xD;
dew, floated up to the windows, and the twitter and song&#xD;
of the birds floated in. The freshness and stillness and&#xD;
calmness of all the earth was most sweet. Faith could not&#xD;
read; she knelt upon a low cushion at the open window&#xD;
and leaned her arms upon the~sill to look out, and breathe,&#xD;
and think and pray. The morning was not unlike her.&#xD;
She was as fresh, and as grave, and as still; and there was&#xD;
a little flutter now and then too in her heart, that went with&#xD;
nothing worse than the song of the birds, though it stirred&#xD;
something more than the leaves of the branches. So Mr.&#xD;
Linden found her.&#xD;
So she met them all at breakfast; with the same unready&#xD;
eyes and lips that Mr. Linden had seen before. It was&#xD;
odd how Faith seemed to have put off the full realization&#xD;
of Thursday till Thursday came. After breakfast 8he was&#xD;
making her escape, but was detained before she reached the&#xD;
staircase. What it was that Mr. Linden fastened in her&#xD;
dress, Faith could not have told; neither did his words tell'&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"You must not think me extravagant, Mignonette,-&#xD;
these are some old gems of mine which I want you to wear&#xD;
in this form." ile gave her one grave kiss and let her go.&#xD;
Faith sped up stairs; and with a fluttering heart went to&#xD;
see what Mr. Linden had done.-.Yes, they were gems,-&#xD;
clear, steadfast, as the eternal truth which they signified,&#xD;
the blue sapphires shone upon Faith's white dress.&#xD;
Faith was alone;~ and she sat before the glass an odd&#xD;
long while, studying the brooch where Mr. Linden had&#xD;
placed it. Her head upon her hand, and with much the&#xD;

&#xD;
same sort of face with which she used long ago to study&#xD;
Pet's letters, or some lesson that Pet's brother had set her,&#xD;
From the sapphires Faith turned to' her Bible. She wag&#xD;
not or would not be interrupted, till it was time to attend&#xD;
to business.&#xD;
The first business was presented for her attention by Miss&#xD;
Linden, who came in; basket in hand. There was no need&#xD;
to ask what it was, such a breath of o~nge flowers anti&#xD;
roses flllel the room. She fou~4,,, Faith ready; her hair&#xD;
dressed as it always was; her mi~d~foo4~o judge by appear-&#xD;
ances. Only Faith was a little more quiet t1~ian usual,&#xD;
With the very quietness of love and sympathy Pet did her&#xD;
part; with the swiftest fingers, the most noiseless steps.&#xD;
Silent as Mrs. Derrick or Faith herself, only a sparkle of&#xD;
the eyes, a pretty flush on the chQeks, said that she viewed&#xD;
the matter from a greater distance. And yet hardly that,&#xD;
so far as one of the parties w~as concerned. Never putting&#xD;
her hand forward where Mrs. Derrick's liked to be, it was&#xD;
most efficient in other places. Both used their skill to put&#xD;
the soft muslin safely over Faith's smooth hair, but then&#xD;
Mrs. Derrick was left to fasten and adjust it-Pet applied&#xD;
herself to adjusting the flowers. How dainty they were!&#xD;
those tiny bunches! sprays of mrytle and orange flowers, or&#xD;
a white rosebud and a more trailing steiii of ivy geranium;&#xD;
the breast-knot just touched with purple heliotrope and&#xD;
one blush rose. Kneeling at her feet to put on the roset..&#xD;
ted slippers, Pet looked up at her new sister with all her&#xD;
heart in her eyes. And Faith looked down at her.-like&#xD;
a child.&#xD;
She had been dressed in Pet's room-her own-as being&#xD;
larger and more commodious than the one where Faith had&#xD;
stowed herself lately; and when the dressing was done she&#xD;
sat down by the open window, and with the odd capricious-&#xD;
ness of the mind at certain times, thought of the day when&#xD;
Mr. Linden had thrown her up the cowslip ball,-and in&#xD;
the same breath wondered who was going to take her down&#xD;
stairs!&#xD;
But she sat quiet, looking as fair in her soft robe with&#xD;
its orange flowers as if they and she had been made for&#xD;
each other. Faith's hair in its rich colour was only dark&#xD;
enough to set off the tender tints of her flowers and dress;&#xD;

* it wanted neither veil nor adornment. Th~1very outlines&#xD;
of het' figure betokened, as outlines are somewhat apt to&#xD;
do, the spirit within; without ~ harsh angle or line. And&#xD;
nothing could be too soft, or strong, or pure, to go with&#xD;
those eyes. She sat looking out into the orchard, where&#xD;
now the noonday of summer held its still reign-nothing&#xD;
there but the grass and the trees and the insects. The cow-&#xD;
slips were gone ; ~ Mr. Linden&#xD;
Pet finished all that had been left unfinished of her own&#xD;
dress? then in her rose-coloured summer silk, white gloves&#xD;
in her hand, white flowers on her breast, ~she came and&#xD;
stood by Faith. Mrs. Derrick had gone down stairs. It&#xD;
was close upon one o'clock now; the shadows were losing&#xD;
their directness and taking a slant line, the laborers were&#xD;
coming back to their work, standing about and taking off&#xD;
their coats, waiting for the clock to strike. Miss Linden&#xD;
~ stood drawing on her gloves. Faith gave her one swift&#xD;
~ glance, which rested for a second on her face with a look&#xD;
~ of loving gratitude. A flush rose to her cheek, as if it&#xD;
~ might have been the reflection of Miss Linden's dress; but&#xD;
~ it was not that, for it paled again.&#xD;
One o'clock!&#xD;
It would have seemed a less .xveird sort of' thing if the&#xD;
clock had made a little more fuss ,-twelve strokes, or even&#xD;
eleven, would have been something tangible; but that one&#xD;
clano'~scarce heard before it was gone, dying away on the&#xD;
~ June breeze,-what a. point of time it seemed! The waves&#xD;
of air were but just at rest, when Mrs. Derrick opened the&#xD;
door and came in; her black dress and white cap setting&#xD;
off a face and demeanour which with all their wanted sweet&#xD;
~ pla~jdness, and amid all the tender influences of the day,&#xD;
kept too their wanted energy.&#xD;
"Come, pretty child ~ she said.&#xD;
Faith was ready, and followed her rnothei~ without a&#xD;
question. In the hall Mr. Linden stood waiting foil' her,&#xD;
and she was given into his care; though again Faith lost&#xD;
the look which passed between the two,-she, saw only the&#xD;
startling white of Mr. Linden's gloves, lie handed her&#xD;
down stairs, then gave her his arm and took her in; Mrs.&#xD;
Derrick going first and Pet following.&#xD;
There were but six or eight people there. On one side&#xD;

sat Mrs. Iredell in her rich dress; the rest were standing,&#xD;
except little Ency Stephens who was in one of her perched&#xD;
up positions by the window. Mr. Somers was lingering&#xD;
about his position, his wife and Mr. and Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
were opposite to Mrs. Iredell. Reuben Taylor furthest back&#xD;
of all, in the shadow of Ency's window. Her little cry was&#xD;
the only sound as they came in, and that hardly louder than&#xD;
a sigh of delight.&#xD;
Faith did not hear it nor look at anybody. Yet she&#xD;
did not look dismayed at all nor abashed. A piece- of&#xD;
very timid gravity the person nearest her knew her to&#xD;
be; but hardly any person further off. A very ~ve1y&#xD;
mingling of shy dignity and humility was in her face and&#xD;
air as she stood before Mr.~ Somers; those who saw it never&#xD;
forgot.&#xD;
Except, I must, that same Mr. Sorn~ers! He saw only a&#xD;
pretty bride whose orange flowers and roses were very&#xD;
sweet. He had seen many pretty bri~c1es before, and orange&#xD;
flowers were not new to him, And he pronounced his part&#xD;
of the service which followed, with gratification, certainly;&#xD;
.-..-Mr. Somers was always gracious and to-day he was ad-&#xD;
miring ;--but yet with i~o more sense of what he was about&#xD;
than when a hundred times before hehad pronounced it for&#xD;
-very different people!&#xD;
However there is a great system of compensations in&#xD;
this world; and on this occasion there was in other mem-&#xD;
bers of the party so much sense of what was doing, that it&#xD;
mattered little about Mr. Somers' want of it. It mattered&#xD;
nothing to Faith, how his words were spoken; nobody that&#xD;
heard themforgot how hers were-the sweet clear sounds&#xD;
of every syllable; only th~t once or twice she said "yes~,&#xD;
where by established formula s e~hould have said the more&#xD;
dignified "I do." Perhaps "yes" meant as much. Those&#xD;
who heard it thought it did.&#xD;
For Mr. Linden-his senses not being troubled by shy.&#xD;
ness-just because his own heart was so thoroughly in what&#xD;
he was about he did perceive the want of heart in Mr.&#xD;
Somers. And, in the abstract, it did not suit his notionS&#xD;
that even a man who had married five hundred other peo~&#xD;
pie should put such questions to Mignonette, or to him, in&#xD;
a commonplace way. So far his senses perceived,-.-.-but&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Somers could reaAh no further. One touch of Faith's&#xD;
hand had banished the officiate to another planet; a~id the&#xD;
vow to love, cherish, and honour, was taken, word for Word,&#xD;
deep in his own heart; the grave, deliberate accents of&#xD;
assent seeming to dwell upon each specification. Yes,-.&#xD;
he took her "for better for worse, in sickness or health, for&#xD;
richer for poorer" !-.ever~ word was like the counti~~g over&#xD;
of gold to him,-it was all "richer." Even the last words-.&#xD;
the limit fixed, shone with light from another world. "Till&#xD;
death shall you part" ;--yes, but to them death would be&#xD;
but a short parting. And standing side by side there with&#xD;
the blessing of his earthly life, Mr. Linden thanked God in&#xD;
his heart for the future "life and iin~ortalit~"to which he&#xD;
had called them both.&#xD;
Mysterious is the way in which events are telegraphed&#xD;
from the inside of a house to the exterior thereof! Hardly&#xD;
were Mr. somers' last words spoken, Faith was not yet out&#xD;
of Mr. Linden's hands, when there ea~ie a peal from the&#xD;
little white church as if the bell-ringing' of two or three&#xD;
Sunday were concentrated in one. Much to the surprise&#xD;
of Mr. Somers; who to speak truth rather thought the&#xD;
bells were his personal property, and as such playing truant,&#xD;
But in two seconds the other bell chimed in; and all that&#xD;
could ever be known, was, that Phil Davids and Joe Dea-&#xD;
con had been seen in closer attendance on the two churches&#xD;
than they were wont to be week days. Meantime, the bells&#xD;
rang.&#xD;
it was done; and those downcast eyes must be lifted up,&#xD;
-if they could. But Faith was not unlike her usual man-&#xD;
ner. The slight air of timidity which sat with such grace&#xD;
upon her was not so very unusual and that besides touched&#xD;
only or mainly one person. With blushing quietness she&#xD;
let her friends kiss and congratulate her. it was ratiter&#xD;
kiss and caress her; for they came about her, that llgtle&#xD;
bevy of friends, v4th a warmth that might have thawed Mr.&#xD;
Somers. ~Mrs. Derrick and Pet glad and silent, Reuben&#xD;
Taylor very shy, the Stoutenburghs in a little furor of in-&#xD;
terest which yet did not break pretty bounds. And then&#xD;
Faith went up to Ency where she sat by the window, and&#xD;
gave her two kisses, very grave and sweet.&#xD;

"How beautiful you are, ma'arn !" was the chuld'~ truth.&#xD;
ful comment.&#xD;
"Do you know who 'Miss F~itl~'is now, Ency ?"&#xD;
"Yes sir," the4child said-then shy of speaking it out..~.&#xD;
"Stoop down and I'll tell~you."&#xD;
Mr. Linden bent his head to hear the whisper, giving&#xD;
her a kiss in return, and then carried Faith off to the next&#xD;
room; where presently too the little lame girl was pehed&#xD;
up at such a table as she had never dreamed of before.&#xD;
It was a pretty gathering, both on the table and around&#xD;
it. The party of friends, few enough to be choice, were&#xD;
good and different enough to be picturesque; and had&#xD;
among them a sufficient amount of personal advantages to&#xD;
be, as Ency said, "beautiful." The table itself was very&#xD;
plain with regard to china and silver; but fruit is beauty.&#xD;
ful, and there was an abundance of that. Coffee of course;&#xD;
and cream, yellow as gold, for coffee and fruit both. There&#xD;
were more substantial things, to serve as substitutes for din.&#xD;
ner, attesting Mrs. Derrick's good housekeeping at once,&#xD;
and the loving remembrance of friends. There had been&#xD;
little need to do mt~h in the house. Mrs. Iredell had taken&#xD;
the wedding cake into her charge, which Mrs. Stoutenbtirgh&#xD;
not knowing had taken it into hers, and into her hands as&#xD;
well; so Faith had both the bought cake, of the richest&#xD;
and best-ornamented to a point,-and the homemade ;-.&#xD;
with plain icing indeed, but wherein every raisin had been&#xD;
thought&#xD;
put with a sweet&#xD;
"This is-ha !-a very agreeable occasion !"-said Mr.&#xD;
Somers, smiling at the ornamented plum cake which was&#xD;
before him.-" 1-a-really, I don't see, Mrs. Derrick, how&#xD;
anything could be improved for the pleasure of the party.&#xD;
We have done a good thing, -and to good people,-and&#xD;
it's been well done ;" (Mr. Somers vaunted himself)-.-." and&#xD;
in a good time,-ha-this is the prettiest month in the&#xD;
year, Mr. Linden ;-and now we are all enjoying a pleasant&#xD;
sight, before us and around us 1-and I ei~joy my coffee&#xD;
also very much, Mrs. Derrick. The only bad thing about&#xD;
it is-ha-that it rather spoils one for the next occasion.&#xD;
I assure you-I haven't seen anything like it in Pattaquas~.&#xD;
set-since I have lived here! I wasn't married here, Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenbnrgh, take notice !"&#xD;

i&#xD;

"I hope you don't mean to say you saw anything that&#xD;
was on the table the day you were married, Mr. Somers 1"&#xD;
said Mrs. Stoutenburgh irreverently.&#xD;
"Let's hear what you mean by well done,.-.-..let's hear,&#xD;
Mr. Somers," said the Squire.&#xD;
"He r~ieans securely," said Mrs. Somers.&#xD;
"I feel sure," said Mr. Somers with exquisite signifi..&#xD;
cancy,-" I feel sure that part of my audience were at no&#xD;
loss for the meaning of my words. Experience, somebody&#xD;
says, is the best commentary-hey, Mr. Linden? is it&#xD;
not so?''&#xD;
"What, sir?"&#xD;
Mr. Somers laughed, gently. "I see you coincide with&#xD;
me in opinion, sir."&#xD;
"I coincide with him in the opinion that it was well done&#xD;
to ring the bells," said Mrs. Stoutenburgh. "Reuben, I&#xD;
guess that was your doing."&#xD;
"Never mind whose it was," said the Squire,-.-."the bells&#xD;
were never put to a better use, week days, I'll venture.&#xD;
Mr. Linden, won't that lady by you let me give her another&#xD;
piece of chicken ?"&#xD;
~ "No, sir,"-~came in a low voice that had a private chime&#xD;
i of its own.&#xD;
Little bird," said Mr. Linden softly, "do you know&#xD;
that all your compeers live by eating ?"&#xD;
'~ "Crumbs "-said Faith with equal softness.&#xD;
"But of proportionate sine 1"&#xD;
1d~~g,~7 said Faith.&#xD;
to our know," he said in the same low voice, "to go back&#xD;
maxim, those bells may stand for the music, and&#xD;
we have certainly spoken a few sensible words; but if you&#xD;
do not look up how will you find the picture ?"&#xD;
She raised her eyes, but it was for a swift full glance up&#xD;
into his face; she looked nowhere else, and her eyes went&#xD;
back to her plate again. The involuntary, unconscious sig-.&#xD;
nificance of the action made Mr. Linden smile.&#xD;
"I have had mine now, Mignonette,-and ~Ency spoke&#xD;
"How long does it take people to get married ?" came&#xD;
in a good-.humoured kind of a growl from the room they&#xD;
had left, the door to which was ajar.-"Aint it done yet ?"&#xD;

"There's Mr. -Simlins, Endecott-" whispered Faith&#xD;
colouring. -&#xD;
" Come in and see !" said Squire Stoutenburgh. "Who&#xD;
wants .to know ?" Wherewith the door was pushed open&#xD;
and Mr. Simlins' long figure presented itself, and stood&#xD;
still.               -    -'&#xD;
"'What are you uneasy about, Mr. Simlins ?" the Squire&#xD;
went on. "You may go and shake hands with Mr. Linden,&#xD;
but don't congratulate anybody else." The farmer's eye&#xD;
rested for a moment on Faith; then he went round and&#xD;
shook hands with the bridegroom.&#xD;
"Is it done ?" he asked again in the midst of this cere-&#xD;
mony. .&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Pase* all help, Mr. Simlins," said Mrs. Somers.&#xD;
"I am, glad, for one !"-Mr. Simlins answered. "Mayn't&#xD;
I see this cretur here ?-I wish you'd stand up and let me&#xD;
look at you."&#xD;
Faith rose up,-he 'had edged along ,to her. He sur-&#xD;
veyed her, profoundly. "Be you Faith Dierrick ?" he said.&#xD;
"Yes sir."&#xD;
He shook her hand then,.holding it fast.~ "It's the true,&#xD;
and not a counter !" lie remarked to Mr. Linden. ".Now&#xD;
if you'd only- take Neanticut !-I could die content, only&#xD;
for liking to live and see you. Where are you going to&#xD;
take her to ?"&#xD;
S"I am not sure' yet."&#xD;
"I guess I don't want you at Neanticut," said' the far-&#xD;
mer, taking a cup of coffee which Faith gave him.-" Last&#xD;
Sunday fixed that. But there'll a bushel of Neanticut nuts&#xD;
follow you every year as long as I'm a Simlins !-if you go&#xD;
to the Antipathies !--No, I don't want anythin' to eat-.&#xD;
I've done my eatin' till supper-time."&#xD;
The door-knocker warned the party that they must not&#xD;
tarry round the lunch-table, and before Mr. Simlins had a&#xD;
chance to say anything more he had on his mind, the prin-&#xD;
cipal personages of the day were receiving Judge Harrison&#xD;
and his daughter in the other room. Mr. Simlins looked&#xD;
on, sonm~rhat grimly, but with inward delight and exulta-&#xD;
tion deep and strong. ,MIiss Sophy was affectionate, the&#xD;
Judge very kind ; the congratulations of both very hearty;&#xD;
&#xD;
though Judge llardson complained that Mr. Linden was&#xD;
robbing Pattaquasset and Sophy echoed the sorrow if not&#xD;
the complaint. In the midst of this came in Miss Essie de&#xD;
Staff with a troop of brothers-and sisters; and they had&#xD;
scarcely paid their compliments when they were obliged to&#xD;
stand aside to make room for some new-comners. Miss&#xD;
Essie's eyes had full employment and were rather earnest&#xD;
about it.&#xD;
"She's beautifully dressed !"-she remarked to Mrs.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh, evidently meditating a good deal more than&#xD;
her words carried.&#xD;
"Why of course !" was Mrs. Stoutenburgh's quick&#xD;
response,-" so is he. iDon't' be partial in your examina-&#xD;
tions."&#xD;
"Oh he,-of course !"--.said Miss Essie, in the same&#xD;
manner.&#xD;
"I never saw two people set each other off better," said&#xD;
Mrs. Stoutenburgh.&#xD;
"Set each other off ?".-repeated Miss Essie. "Why he'd&#xD;
set anybody off! I always admired him. Look at her !-&#xD;
she hasn't an idea how to be ceremonious. "'-Faith had been&#xD;
speaking to Mrs. Iredell. Just then a rosebud having de-&#xD;
tached itself from her dress, she went round' the room to&#xD;
Ency by her window and gave it to her. Near this window&#xD;
Miss Linden had placed herself; the table before her cov-&#xD;
ered with wedding cake and whie-ribband, Reuben Taylor&#xD;
at her side to cut and fold, her little fingers daintily wrap-&#xD;
ping and tying up. Ency already held her piece of cake&#xD;
and white ribband, and with the promise of other pieces to&#xD;
take home watched Miss Linden's proceedings with interest.&#xD;
It was a busy table,-for thither came everybody else after&#xD;
cake and white ribband. Thither came Mrs.'Stoutenburgh&#xD;
now, quitting Miss Essie.&#xD;
"Faith, what do you think Mr. Stoutenburgh asked me&#xD;
Sunday ?"&#xD;
"I don't know. What ?"-asked Faith with her half&#xD;
shy, half free, very happy face.&#xD;
"You should have heard him !" said Mrs. Stoutenburgh&#xD;
laughing, but speaking in the softest of whispers. "You&#xD;
should have heard the dismal way in which lhe asked me if&#xD;

Mr. Somers would go anywhere e      if he could get a&#xD;
Faith smiled, but evidently to her the question whether&#xD;
Mr. Linden should stay in .Pattaquasset had lost its&#xD;
interest.&#xD;
"0 r can find her-never fear !" said Miss Bezac, fol..&#xD;
lowed by Mix ~Linden in Faith's direction. "Though II&#xD;
don't suppos&amp;amp;:pu ever did fear anything. And I do sup.&#xD;
pose, if I've thought once I have fifty times how she'd look&#xD;
to-day--and I was right every time. Don't she look! I&#xD;
always told her she didn't know what she ~v anted-and I'm&#xD;
sure she don't now I" With which Miss Be~ac gave Faith as&#xD;
hearty a congratulation as she had yet received. "Well-"&#xD;
she said, turning to Mr. Linden, - "do you wonder I&#xD;
wanted to make it ?"&#xD;
"Not in the least !"&#xD;
But what do I want, Miss Bezac?" said Faith laughing&#xD;
~nd looking affectionately at her ojd friend and fellow work-&#xD;
woman.&#xD;
"Why I should think, nothing-" said Miss Bezac. "So&#xD;
it seems to me. And talking of seams-didn't I (10 yours!&#xD;
Do you know I should have come before, but I never can&#xD;
see two people promise to love each other forever without&#xD;
crying - and crying always makes rusty needles, - so I&#xD;
wouldn't come till now, when everybody's laughing." Faith&#xD;
was an exception, for her amusement grew demure. And&#xD;
Miss Essie approached&#xD;
Now Miss Essie's black eyes, although bright enough,&#xD;
were' altogether gracious and in a certain way even propi-&#xD;
tiatory. They were bent upon the gentleman of the&#xD;
group.&#xD;
"Mr. Linden," said the lady with her most flattering&#xD;
manner,-" I want to know if you have forgiven me all my&#xD;
dreadful speeches that~ I made once 1"-.&#xD;
"Miss Essie, I never questioned your right to make them&#xD;
.-..therefore you see my forgiveness has no place." Miss&#xD;
Essie looked as if her 'study' of Mr. Linden hadn't been&#xD;
thorough.~&#xD;
"Thafs very polite," she said; "too polite. But do&#xD;
you think Mrs. Linden will ever let me come into her&#xD;
house ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"Why not? It ~~not be worse than you imagined."&#xD;
"Because," said Miss Essie earnestly,-" I want to come,&#xD;
and I am afraid she will not ask me. I go everywhere, and&#xD;
wherever you are I shall be sure to come there some time;&#xD;
and then I want to see you and see how you live-and see ~&#xD;
if my theory was mistaken. But I drew it from expe&#xD;
ence&#xD;
"D~id you ever hear of the ice palace th~ little brooks&#xD;
built for himself?" said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"Lowell-oh yes !".-&#xD;
"Mrs. Linden thinks she would like to try that."&#xD;
If ever black eyes were thoroughly puzzled, that were&#xD;
Miss Essie's! She glanced from Mr. I4nden to Faith, who&#xD;
had fallen back towards e~nother part of the room, but&#xD;
whose check gave token of her having heard and noticed.&#xD;
Miss Essie's eyes caine back; she looked a little mortified.&#xD;
"I see you have not forgiven me," she said. "But, Mr.&#xD;
Linden, I only spoke of wlz~at I had seen. I had been un-&#xD;
fortunate and I am sure I needn't confine myself to the&#xD;
past tense! I knew nothing, you know."&#xD;
"Miss E~sie," he said smiling, "your frame for the picture&#xD;
may be correct-but the picture will be different. As you&#xD;
will see when you come."&#xD;
"Then, you will let me come ?" ~'&#xD;
"I will let you come. Only if you hear that Faith is not&#xD;
at home, do not feel sure of the fact till you have looked in&#xD;
my study."&#xD;
Miss Essie's face for a moment was notable; she was in&#xD;
a certain way satisfied, and yet it wore a sort of compound&#xD;
mortification-inexplicable very likely to the lady herself;&#xD;
and perhaps that only~.an acute eye of another would have&#xD;
read.&#xD;
Before this dialogue had reached so much of a culmina-&#xD;
tion, Mr. Simlins, who had been standing hooking at every-&#xD;
thing like a good-humoured bear,-made his way across the&#xD;
room and through the people to Faith, where she had&#xD;
shrunk back out of the way. /&#xD;
"I can't stay here all the afternoon !" said he,-" and I&#xD;
s'pose it aint expected of me. Can't you step over yonder&#xD;
and let a man have a chance to say a word to you-before&#xD;
Igo?"&#xD;

Faith agreed to this proposition, not knowing that it was&#xD;
going to take her literally into a corner; but to one of the&#xD;
further corners of the room Mr. Simlins strode, and Faith&#xD;
went after him; and there he sat down and she was fain to&#xD;
do likewise. Then he Wasn't ready.&#xD;
"I had something' to say to you,".-.-said he,-" but I don't&#xD;
know how to say it!"-&#xD;
"Try, Mr. Simlins," said Faith smiling.&#xD;
"flow does the dominie manage to talk to you ?".-said&#xD;
he looking at her. "I don't see how he can get on with it."&#xD;
Faith grew crimson, and grave.&#xD;
"'Well," said the farmer, smiling a bit,-" I s'pose I'll&#xD;
have to get it out somehow. You see, Faith,-the thing&#xD;
is, in my mind, I want you to have something that'll make&#xD;
you-you and him too-think of Pattaquasset and me&#xD;
once in a while. Now I'm goin' to give you that black&#xD;
heifer. If you can, I hope you'll take her with you where.&#xD;
ever you're '-if you can't, why you may turn her into&#xD;
cash-but II guess you can. She's a real Simlins-she'l1&#xD;
run, if you don't keep a fence round her; but if you treat&#xD;
her right, she'll give you all your dairy'll want for some&#xD;
time to come; and the very plague you'll he at to keep her&#xD;
shut up will make you think of me."&#xD;
"Dear Mr. Simlins !"-Faith said with her eyes full-.&#xD;
"there is no danger about that!"-&#xD;
"No !"-..said he rising, "and when you think of me I&#xD;
know you'll do something else for me. Good-bye-till you&#xD;
get back again." Off he went. Other people followed.&#xD;
The room had thinned a little, when Pet left her table in&#xD;
Reuben's charge and came to Faith's corner.&#xD;
"Poor child," she 0said, "you must be tired. Faith I shall&#xD;
defy ceremony and put you in Aunt Iredell's chair-she is&#xD;
going to lie down. Oh !-how did that man get here !-.-.&#xD;
and George Alcott 1" Pet faced round upon Faitb, folding&#xD;
her hands with an air of dismayed resignation.&#xD;
"What's the matter, Pet ?"&#xD;
"I thought I was safe, here," said Miss Linden. "Faith,&#xD;
I did not suppose ubiquitous people found their way to&#xD;
Pattaquasset. You'll haye to run the gauntlet of that&#xD;
man's compliments, child-however, Endy is a pretty good&#xD;
safeguard."&#xD;
&#xD;
Before Faith could see much of what was going on, Mr.&#xD;
Linden was at her side. "Mrs. Linden-Air. Motley," was&#xD;
all he said; and Faith found herself face to face with one of&#xD;
those two well remembered strangers. So well remembered&#xD;
that her slight glance at him was arrested, by what at first&#xD;
she did not recognize, and unconsciously she gave Mr. Mot-&#xD;
ley for a second a look sufficiently like what he had seen&#xD;
before to identify her. That second brought it all back. '~&#xD;
A blush of most rosy beauty came upon Faith's face, and&#xD;
her eyes fell as if no one was ever to see them again. Mr.&#xD;
Motley's eyes, on the contrary, expanded. But the whistle&#xD;
which rose politely to his lips, was held in polite check-.&#xD;
by Mr. Linden's presence or some other consideration-and&#xD;
with no further sign than an under breath "Linden !" Mr.&#xD;
Motley gave the bride his hand, claiming that privilege in&#xD;
easy, musky words, on the score of old acquaintanceship&#xD;
with the bridegroom.&#xD;
"I trust Mrs. Linden has been well since I last (and&#xD;
first!) had the pleasure of seeing her? Apart from the&#xD;
occasion-it seems to me that she is looking even better&#xD;
than then-though then I should not have believed that&#xD;
possible."&#xD;
"It is a long time, sir,"-Faith sa~id gravely.&#xD;
"Linden," said Mr. Motley in a sort of aside, "even your&#xD;
symmetrical taste must be satisfied !"-.&#xD;
"With what ?" said Mr. Linden. Which rather shortly&#xD;
put question brought Mr. Motley to a stand. Much as&#xD;
when one pushes on into daylight, through the filmy fine-&#xD;
spun work of a spider, that respectable insect looks about,&#xD;
considering where he shall begin anew.&#xD;
"It is so long," said Mr. Motley with soft emphasis,&#xD;
"that I could hardly have hoped to be remembered."&#xD;
"If I recollect right," said Mr. Linden,-" if you did not&#xD;
misstate the case-it was the charms of your conversation&#xD;
that made the impression."&#xD;
"You are the most inconvenient person to talk to !" said&#xD;
Mr. Motley With a glance at the handsome face, "Like a&#xD;
quicksand-closing around one. Mrs. Linden, do you not&#xD;
find it so? Ah-George !-talking to Miss Pet as usual.&#xD;
Permit me-Mrs. Linden, Mr. Alcott. George, you cannot&#xD;

have forgotten Mrs. Linden ?"-That George had not was&#xD;
very clear.&#xD;
And that Faith had not forgotten, was very clear. She&#xD;
lifted her eyes once more, to see if the second was the&#xD;
second; and then stood, with the most exquisite cheeks,&#xD;
though perfectly quiet. Tier gloves had not been Put on&#xD;
again since the lunch, and the hand that held them bore&#xD;
also the ring wlAch had been the gentlemen's admiration.&#xD;
"Now what do you think, George," said Mr. Motley,&#xD;
"of Linden's letting me tell Julius Harrison that whole&#xD;
story, and never giving the least hint that he knew the&#xD;
lady referred to ?-Except---yes once indeed, I do remember,&#xD;
Mrs. Linden, his face took a warm reflection of the sub-&#xD;
ject, -.but I thought that was due to my powers as a&#xD;
"You couldn't high colour that picture," said Mr. Alc6tt,&#xD;
in a tone Faith remembered well. "Mrs. Linden, I hope&#xD;
we are to see you at Newport."&#xD;
Faith felt in a tumult with all these 'Mrs. Lindens.' But&#xD;
all that seemed unquiet about het, besides her cheeks, was&#xD;
the flashing ring.&#xD;
"Well, we must tear ourselves away from this place of&#xD;
fascination," said Mr. Motley. "I believe, Mrs. Linden,&#xD;
we ought to apologize for our intrusion-but it~ was an old&#xD;
sayingamong this gentleman's friends that he never would&#xD;
submit to 'bonds and imprisonment '- (there goes the&#xD;
Bible again 1)-and some of them had a long standing per-&#xD;
mission to come and believe their eyes if such an event ever&#xD;
should take place. I can hardly~, now 1"&#xD;
"Why do you, sir ?" Faith asked sini~dy.&#xD;
"Really madam, because I can't helpkitl One look at&#xD;
you, Mrs. Linden, is enough. In some circumstances all a&#xD;
man can do is to surrender 1"&#xD;
"He needn't till he's summoned-" said George Alcott&#xD;
shortly. Though whether he had acted so wisely himself:,&#xD;
was a question-as Mr. Linden said amusedly after they&#xD;
were gone.&#xD;
Faith turned away, feeling as if she had rather more than&#xD;
enough, and occupied herself with Reuben and Ency again.&#xD;
Then came in Farmer IDavids and his wife, and Phil. Phil&#xD;
was forthwith in a state of 'glamour'; but Faith brought&#xD;

him to the table and gave him cake and discoursed to him&#xD;
and Reuben; while Mrs. Davids talked to Mrs. Derrick in&#xD;
wonderful delighted admiration~ and&#xD;
fixed upon Mr. Linden.            the farmer as usual&#xD;
"We had the uncommon pleasure of hearIn' you speak&#xD;
last Sunday, sir,"-said Mr. David~ with great seriousness.&#xD;
"I sha'n't forget it, what you said. And you don't know&#xD;
where you're going to fix yourself, sir ~&#xD;
"Not certainly."&#xD;
"I would rather than half what I sell oft' the farm, that&#xD;
it was going to be where I could be within reach of you,&#xD;
sir! But wherever 'tis-Phil and I, we con silted how we&#xD;
could contrive to shew our sense of this day-we're plain&#xD;
folks, Mr. Linden, and we didn't know how to fit-But if&#xD;
you'll let us know where you're goin' to be, Mrs. Davids&#xD;
she wants to send your wife a cheese, and there's some of&#xD;
Phil's apples, and I want you to have some Pattaquasset&#xD;
flour to make you think of us. And if you'll only think of&#xD;
us every year as long as they come, it's all I ask 1" It was&#xD;
said with the most honest expression of struggling regard,&#xD;
and respect, that wanted to shew itself.&#xD;
Then Mr. Linden was claimed by a new comer. Sam&#xD;
Stoutenburgh, fresh from College, Quilipeak, and the tailor,&#xD;
presented himself. Now it was rather a warm day-and&#xD;
trains are not cool, nd haste is not a refrigerator,-never-&#xD;
theless Sam's cheek were high coloured! His greeting of&#xD;
Mr. Linden was far less off-hand and dashing than was&#xD;
usual with this new Junior; and when carried off to Mrs.&#xD;
Linden, Sam (to use an elegant word) was 'flustered.'&#xD;
"Miss Faith," he began. "No-I don't mean that 1-I&#xD;
beg your pai'don-but I'i~ very glad to see you again, and&#xD;
I wish you were going to stay here always."&#xD;
Faith laughed. "Will you stay here always yourself, Sam ?"&#xD;
"0 I don't know," said Sam. "It's a while before I've&#xD;
got to do anything yet. But Miss Faith--..I mean !-.-.since&#xD;
you will go, won't you please take thisb?" -and Sam pre-&#xD;
sented a ti~y box containing a pretty goki ~et cornelian&#xD;
seal, en~rai~ed with a spirited Jehu chariot running away!&#xD;
"It'll remind you of a day I shall never forget," said Sam&#xD;
both honestly and sentimentally. If Mr, i~IApd~n CQuid&#xD;

Faith's face was in a quiver, between laughter and very&#xD;
much deeper and stronger feeling. But she shook Sam's&#xD;
hand again gratefully.&#xD;
"I shall never forget it, Sam,-nor what you did for me&#xD;
that day. And I hope you'll come and see me somewhere&#xD;
else-some time." Then Mr. Linden spoke.&#xD;
'~ No one can owe you so much for that day's work as I,&#xD;
Sam,-and since she is running away again, you must do&#xD;
as you did then and find her."&#xD;
Sam was somewhat touched and overwhelmed, and went&#xD;
off to talk to Reuben about Miss Linden's dress. A little&#xD;
while longer and the room was cleared. The two eol1~gi~&#xD;
ans came last of all to say good-bye, Reuben lingering&#xD;
behind his friend.&#xD;
"You know" said Mr. Linden, holding the boy's hand,&#xD;
"you are eemin~ to study with me, Reuben, if I live; we&#xD;
will not call it good-bye. And I shall expect to see you&#xD;
before that in vacation."&#xD;
"And you know, Reuben," said Faith very low,-" you&#xD;
have been a brother to me this great while."&#xD;
Reuben looked down, trying for words. Then meeting&#xD;
Faith's eyes as he had done that very first time -what&#xD;
though his own were full, he said, "I am not sorry, ma'am&#xD;
.-I am glad! So glad," he repeated, looking from her&#xD;
face to Mr. Linden's. But his eyes fell then; and hastily&#xD;
.clasping ~the hand she held out to him, jjie bent his face to&#xD;
Mr. Linden~s and turned away. tine quick step Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den took after him, and- they left the room arm in arm,&#xD;
after the old fashion.&#xD;
With Mr. Linden when he came back, was an oldish gen-&#xD;
tleman, silver-haired, with a fresh ruddy face; not very tall,&#xD;
very pleasant-looking. Pet's exclamation was of joy this&#xD;
time, and she ran forward to meet him. Then Mr. Linden&#xD;
brought him up to Faith. ~' Mignonette, this is my dear&#xD;
friend, Mr. Olyphant." And Mr. Olyphant took both her&#xD;
hands and kissed her on both cheeks, as if he meant to b~&#xD;
her friend too. Then looked at her without letting go.&#xD;
"Endecott !" he said turning to Mr. Linden, "whatever&#xD;
you undertake you always do well 1" And he shook Faith's&#xD;
hands again, and told her he could wish her joy wAh a clear&#xD;
conscience.&#xD;
&#xD;
The timid little smile which this remark procured him,&#xD;
might have~ confirmed the old gentleman in his first expressed&#xD;
opinion. Mr. Olyphant studied her a minute, not con-&#xD;
fusingly but with a sort of touched kindliness.&#xD;
"What do you call her, Endecott ?" he said.&#xD;
"Any sweet name I can think of," said Mr. Linden smil-&#xD;
ing,-.--"just now, Mignonette." Which remark had a mer-&#xD;
ciless effect upon Faith's cheeks.&#xD;
"It suits her, Mr. Olyphant," said Pet.&#xD;
"So I see, Miss Pet-do you think I have lost my eyes?&#xD;
Endecott, are you going to bring her to the White Moun-&#xD;
tains ?"&#xD;
"I think so, sir: that is my present inclination."&#xD;
"How would you like it, Mrs. Linden ?"&#xD;
"I think I should like it, sir."&#xD;
"Not afraid of the cold?"&#xD;
Faith's smile clearly was n9t afraid of anything. So ~vas&#xD;
her answer.&#xD;
"You must have a house midway on the slope," said Mr.&#xD;
Olyphant; "half your ~parish above your heads, half at&#xD;
your feet: and you will have plenty of snow, and plenty of&#xD;
work, and not much els~-.--but each other, Endecott's face&#xD;
says that is being very rich~-but he always was an Dnworldly&#xD;
sort of fellow, Mrs. Linden,-I don't think he ever saw the&#xD;
real gli4r. of gold, yet."&#xD;
Did h eyes? But they were unconsciously looking at&#xD;
riches of some kind; there was no poverty in them. "I&#xD;
like work, sir."&#xD;
"Do you think she could bear the cold, Mr. Olyphant ?.-.-..&#xD;
how are the winters there? That is what I have thought&#xD;
of most."&#xD;
"I am no more afraid of the cold-than you are, Ende-&#xD;
cott." How gently the last word was spoken! But Faith&#xD;
clearly remembered her lesson. Mr. Linden smiled.&#xD;
"She is a real little Sunbeam," he said. "You know&#xD;
they make light of cold weather."&#xD;
"Light of it in two ways," said Mr. Olyphant. "No-&#xD;
I don't think you need fear the winters for her,-we'd try&#xD;
and protect her."&#xD;
"Do you see how much good the Sunbeam has done him,&#xD;
Mr. Olyphant ?" said Pet.&#xD;

"I see it; Miss Pet,-it does me good. I meant to have&#xD;

train. I shall miss it again now, if I am not careful. But&#xD;
you must come up and stay with us, and we'll arraflge mat..&#xD;
ters. Such neighbours may tempt me to winter in the&#xD;
mountains myself-and thei~ I shall take charge of you,&#xD;
3liss Pet."&#xD;
"I should like that," said Pet.&#xD;
"I see, my dear Mrs. Linden," said Mr. Olyphant smil-&#xD;
big at her, "I see you follow one of the old Jewish laws."&#xD;
"What is that, sir?"&#xD;
"You know it was required of the Jews that they should&#xD;
bear the words of the law 'as frontlets between the ~eyes'.&#xD;
Now-if you will forgive me for sayiI~g so-in your eyes&#xD;
is written one of the proverbs."&#xD;
"Look up, Mignonette, and let me see," said Mr. Lin..&#xD;
den. But oddly, Faith looked down first; then the eyes&#xD;
were lifted.&#xD;
"Is truth a proverb ?" said Pet laughing.&#xD;
"0 you see too many things there !" said Mr. Olyphant,&#xD;
.-" this is what I see, Endec~at-' The heart of her husband&#xD;
doth safely trust in her'."-&#xD;
A little veil of shyness and modesty suddenly fell around&#xD;
Faith. Even her head drooped. But Mr. Linden's lips&#xD;
touched the fair brow between those very fair eyes.&#xD;
"I cannot praise your discernment, sir," he said. "It is&#xD;
not more true than evident."&#xD;
"I cannot half congratulate either of you," said Mr.&#xD;
Olyphant smiling, "so I'll go. Good-bye, Miss Pet-re-&#xD;
member next winter. Mrs. Linden we shall expect to see&#xD;
you long before that time. Let me have a word with you,&#xD;
Endecott." And Faith was again left alone, entirely&#xD;
this time, for Miss Linden went up stairs to attend Mrs.&#xD;
Iredell.&#xD;
As they turned to go out, Faith turned the other way&#xD;
and sat down, feeling overwhelmed. Everything w~s very&#xD;
still. Pet's light steps passed off in the distance; through&#xD;
the open windows came the song of kildeers and robins,&#xD;
the breath of roses, the muslin-veiled sunshine. Then she&#xD;
heard Mr. Olyphant's carriage drive oft' tmd Mr. Linden&#xD;
came back. Faith started up. And very lovely she looked,&#xD;

&#xD;
453&#xD;
&#xD;
with the timid grace of those ~till dyed cheeks and veiled&#xD;
brow.&#xD;
"My poor little tired Mignonette !" he said as he came&#xD;
up to her~ Then lifted her face, and looking at it a moment&#xD;
with a h~df smile pressed his lips again where they had&#xD;
been so lately. But this time that did not satisfy him.&#xD;
"Endy..~.-" she said, presently, "please don't praise me&#xD;
before other people !"-.--..&#xD;
"What dreadful thing did I say ?" inquired Mr. Linden&#xD;
laughing. "Do you know I have hardly seen my wife yet ?"&#xD;
....-To judge by Faith's face, neither had she.&#xD;
"If I speak of her at all I must speak the truth. But&#xD;
Mr. Olyphant knows me of old-he will not take my woids&#xD;
for more than they are worth."&#xD;
A slight commentary of a smile passed, but Faith did&#xD;
not adventure any repartee.&#xD;
"Are you very tired ?"&#xD;
"Oh no!"&#xD;
"Little bird !" said Mr. Linden holding her close. "What&#xD;
sort of a sweet spirit was it that said those words at my side&#xD;
this morning ?"&#xD;
There was no answer at first; and then, very quaint and&#xD;
soft the words,-" Only Faith Derrick."&#xD;
"'Only.'.-Faith, did you hear my parting direction to&#xD;
Miss Essie ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Do you agree to it, Mrs. Linden ?"&#xD;
He had spoken that name a good many times that day,&#xD;
and to be sure her cheeks had more or less acknowledged&#xD;
it; but this time it brought such a rush of colour that she&#xD;
stooped her face to be out of sight.&#xD;
"Do you want Miss Reason to answer that question, sir ?"&#xD;
"No, nor Miss anybody."&#xD;
"Prudence would say, there are shortcakes," said Faith.&#xD;
"Where ?"&#xD;
"In ~- hypothesis."&#xD;
"If your shortcakes outweigh my study, Faith, they will&#xD;
be heavier than I ever saw them !"&#xD;
"You wouldn't take ReasoiPs answer," said Faith.&#xD;
"What would it have been ?"&#xD;
She looked up, a swift little ~Lughing glanc~ into his face.&#xD;

* "Parlez, Madame-.s'il vous plait."&#xD;
Her look changed. "You know, Endy, I would rather&#xD;
be there than anywhere else in the world !"&#xD;
It moved him; the happiness to which his look bore wit..&#xD;
ness was of a kind too deep for words.&#xD;
"Do you know, love, if we had been going at once to&#xD;
our work in the mountains, I should have asked a great&#xD;
many people to come here .to~day.~~&#xD;
"Would you ?-Why, Endy ?"&#xD;
"To let them see my wife. Now, I mean to take her to&#xD;
see them."&#xD;
Faith was willing he should take her where he pleased,&#xD;
though she made no remark. Her timidity moved in a&#xD;
small circle and touched principally him. Mingling with&#xD;
this, and in all she did, ever since half past one o'clock 1~o.&#xD;
day, there had been a sort of dignity of grave happiness;&#xD;
very rare, very beautiful.&#xD;
"I wonder if you know half how lovely and dear you&#xD;
are ?" said Mr. Linden, studying the fair outlines of char.&#xD;
aeter as well as of feature. But Faith's eye went all down&#xD;
the pattern of embroidery on her white robe, and never&#xD;
dared meet his. "Have you any idea, little Mignonettc of&#xD;
sweetness, after what fashion that proverb is true ?"&#xD;
She looked up, uncertain what proverb he meant; but&#xD;
then immediately certain, bent her head again. Faith never&#xD;
thought of herself as Mr. Linden thought of her. Moving&#xD;
of humility and determination were in her heart now, but&#xD;
she knew he would not bear to hear her speak them, and~&#xD;
her own voice was not just ready. So she was only silent&#xD;
still.&#xD;
"What will make you speak ?" said Mr. Linden smiling.&#xD;
.-" I am like All Baba before the storehouse of hid&#xD;
treasure. Is this the 'Sesame' you are waiting for ?" he&#xD;
added, raising her face and trying two or three persuasive&#xD;
kisses.&#xD;
"There was nothing in the storehouse," said Faith laughs&#xD;
ingly. "No words, I mean."&#xD;
"I am willing to take thoughts.&#xD;
"How?"&#xD;
"Which way you like I"&#xD;
"Then you will have to wait for them, Endy."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mignonette, I am of an impatient disposition."&#xD;
"Yes-I know it."&#xD;
"Is it to be your first wifely undertaking to cure me 7"&#xD;
he said laughing.&#xD;
"It takes time to put thoughts into action," said Faith&#xD;
blushing.&#xD;
"Not all thoughts, Mignonette."&#xD;
She coloured-beautifully; but anything more pure and&#xD;
sweet than those first wifely kisses of Faith, could not be&#xD;
told. Did he kpow, had he felt, all the love and allegiance&#xD;
they had so silently and timidly spoken? She had reason&#xD;
to think so.&#xD;

CIIAPTER XL.&#xD;
I N a low whitewashed room, very clean though little and&#xD;
plain, where the breeze blew in fresh from the sea, Faith&#xD;
found herself established Friday afternoon. Mr. Linden&#xD;
bad promised to shew her the surf, and so had brought her&#xD;
down to a little village, long ago known to him, on the&#xD;
New England shore; where the people lived by farming&#xD;
and fishing, and no hotel attracted or held an influx of city&#xD;
life. It was rather late in the day, for the journey had&#xD;
been in part off the usual route of railway and steam, and&#xD;
therefore had been longer if not wearier. But when Faith&#xD;
had got rid of the dust, Mr. Linden came to her door to&#xD;
say that it would be half an hour to supper and ask if she&#xD;
was too tired to walk down to the beach.&#xD;
The shore was but a few hundred yards from the little&#xD;
farmhouse; green grass, with interrupting rocks, extending&#xD;
all the way. Faith hardly knew what sh~ was coming to,&#xD;
till she reached the brink. There the precipitous rocks&#xD;
rose sheer a hundred feet from the bottom, and at the bot~&#xD;
tom, down below her, a narrow strip of beach was bordered&#xD;
with the billowy crest and foam of the sea. Nothing but&#xD;
the dark ocean and the illimitable ocean line beyond; there&#xD;
was not even a sail in sight this evening; in full uninter-&#xD;
rupted power and course, from the broad east, the swells&#xD;
of the sea rolled in and broke-broke,-with their graceful,&#xD;
grand monotony.&#xD;
The beach was narrow at height of tide; now the tide&#xD;
was out. Fishermen's boats were drawn up near to the&#xD;
rocks, and steep narrow pathways along and down the face&#xD;
of them allowed the fishermen to go from the top to the&#xD;
bottom.&#xD;
"Can't we get down there ?" said Faith when she had&#xD;
stood a minute looking silently. her face showed an eager&#xD;
readiness for action.&#xD;
"Can you fly, little bird ?"&#xD;
"Yes-As well as the fishermen can&#xD;
"If you cannot I can carry you," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
(456)/&#xD;
&#xD;
And doubtless he would have found some way to make&#xD;
his words good had there been need,-.as it was, he only&#xD;
guarded her down the steep rocky way, going before her&#xD;
and holding her hand in a grasp she would have been puz..&#xD;
zled to get away from. But Faith was light and free of&#xD;
foot and gave him no trouble. Once at the bottom, she&#xD;
went straight towards those in-coming big waves,-.~and in&#xD;
front of them stood still. The sea breeze blew in her face,&#xD;
the roar of the breakers made music in her ears. Faith&#xD;
folded one hand upon tl~e other and stood motionless.&#xD;
Now and then the win,~ caught the spray from some&#xD;
beaten rock and flung i in her face, and wave after wave&#xD;
rose up and donned its krhite crest; the upstanding green&#xD;
water touched with sun rr1~t and shadow and changing&#xD;
tints of amber and olive, down which the white foam came&#xD;
curling and rushing-sweeping in knots of seaweed and&#xD;
leaving all the pebbles with wet faces. Mr. Linden let her&#xD;
look without the interruption of a word, but he presently&#xD;
~ put his arm round her, and drew her a little into shelter&#xD;
~oin the strong breeze. It was a while before she moved&#xD;
from her steady gaze at the xvater, then she looked up, the&#xD;
joy of her face breaking into a smile.&#xD;
"Endccott,.-.--xvill you shew me anything more grand than&#xD;
this ?"&#xD;
"You shall tell me, when you have seen the uprising&#xD;
mists of Niagara," he answered smiling,-"or the ravines&#xD;
between snow-caps 'five thousand summers old'."&#xD;
iler eye went back to the sea. "It brings before me,&#xD;
somehow," she said slowly,.-.-." all time, and all eternity !-.-.&#xD;
I have been thinking here of myself as I was a little child,&#xD;
and as I shall be,.-.and as I am," she added with her in~&#xD;
veterate exactness, and blushing. "I seem to see only the&#xD;
great scale of everything. "-.-.&#xD;
"Tell me a little more clearly what you see," said Mr.&#xD;
IAnden.&#xD;
"It isn't worth telling. I see everything here as belong-&#xD;
mg to God. The world seems his great work-place, and&#xD;
life his time for doing the work7 and I-.--and you,"-she&#xD;
said with a flash of light coming across her face,-" his&#xD;
work people. And those great breaking waves, somehow,&#xD;
seem to me like the resistless-sure-beautifu]4...doings of&#xD;

bidden, evidently.&#xD;
"Do you know how many other things they are like ?~&#xD;
or rather how many are likened to them in the Bible ?"&#xD;
"No! I don't know the Bible as you do."&#xD;
"They seem to be a never failing image-an illustration&#xD;
suiting very different things. 'The wicked are like the&#xD;
troubled sea, when it cannot rest,'-and~then---' 0 that thou&#xD;
hadst hearkened to me! then had thy peace been as a river,&#xD;
and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.'&#xD;
"There is the endless struggle of human will and pur.&#xD;
pose against the divine-' The floods 'have lifted up, 0&#xD;
Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift&#xD;
up their waves. The Lord on high is mightier than the&#xD;
noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the&#xD;
sea.' 'Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not treni.&#xD;
ble at my presence, which have placed the sand for the&#xD;
bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass&#xD;
it: and though the waves thereof toss themselves, yet can&#xD;
they not prevail: though they roar, yet can they not pass&#xD;
over it?' And so in another place the image is reversed,&#xD;
and God says, 'Behold I am against thee, 0 Tyrus, and&#xD;
will cause many nations to come up against thee, as the&#xD;
sea causeth his waves to come up.' Could anything be&#xD;
more forcible ?"&#xD;
A look was Faith's answer; it spoke the kindled thoughts&#xD;
at work.&#xD;
"Then you know," Mr. Linden went on, "how often the&#xD;
troubles of God's children are compared to the ocean; as&#xD;
David says, 'All thy waves are gone over me.' But then&#xD;
the Lord answers to that, 'When th6u passes through the&#xD;
waters I will be with thee, and through the floods, they&#xD;
shall not overwhelm thee;' and David himself in another&#xD;
place declares it to be true-' 0 Lord God of hosts, who is&#xD;
a strong Lord like unto thee? or, to thy faithfulness round&#xD;
~ about thee? Thou rules the raging of the sea: when the&#xD;
waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.'.-.-I suppose," he&#xD;
added thoughtfully, taking both her hands in his, "this is&#xD;
one sense in which by and by 'there shall be no more sea'&#xD;

have gotten the victory' !"&#xD;

&#xD;
Another look, a grave, full look, came to him from&#xD;
Faith; and grave and soft her eye went hack to the sea.&#xD;
The sunbeams were all off it; it was dark and foamy.&#xD;
Speaking rather low, half to her half to himself, Mr. Lin~&#xD;
den went on~&#xD;
"'And they overcame by the blood of the Lamb and by&#xD;
the word of their testimony: and they loved not their lives&#xD;
unto the death'."&#xD;
Her look did not move. Mr. Linden's went with it for&#xD;
a minute or two, but then it came back to her differently.&#xD;
"My darling, I am afraid to have you stay here any&#xD;
longer."&#xD;
"We can come again !" said Faith gleefully as she turned&#xD;
away. "I want to look at them a great deal."&#xD;
"We will come again and try how far a 'ladder' can&#xD;
reach from this low sand."&#xD;
She looked back for another glance as she began to&#xD;
mount the rocky way. The mounting was an easy matter,&#xD;
for Mr. Linden came close and took hold of her in such&#xD;
fashion that she was more than half carried up.&#xD;
"Do you feel as if you had wings now ?" he asked her,&#xD;
after a somewhat quick "flight" up half the way.&#xD;
"Folded ones," said Faith laughing and breathless. "I&#xD;
don't know what sort yours can be !-.---I can go up by my~&#xD;
self; Endecott."&#xD;
"With folded wings, as you remark, Mrs. Linden. Do&#xD;
you remember that infallible way of recognizing 'earth's&#xD;
angels,' when they are not plumbing themselves ?"&#xD;
"They never do 'plume themselves '," said Faith stopping&#xD;
to look at him.&#xD;
*    "Not when they are carried 1"&#xD;
Faith's laugh rolled down the rocks; and then as they&#xD;
reached the top she grew timid and quiet, a mood which&#xD;
came Over her whenever she remembered her new position&#xD;
and name in the world.&#xD;
There is no room to tell all the seaside doings of those&#xD;
.; days; the surf bathing, a~d fishing beyond the surf. A.&#xD;
J week passed there, or rather more; then, Mr. Linden&#xD;
having business in New York, the "wooden horse" went&#xD;
that way. We cannot follow all its travels. But we must&#xD;
stay with it a day in the city.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLI.&#xD;
JI~ VERYBODY who has travelled on the great route&#xD;
from Pattaquasset to New York, knows that the&#xD;
scenery is not striking. Pleasant it is, and fresh, in fresh&#xD;
seasons of the year,-cornfields and hayfields and spark-&#xD;
ling little rivers always make up a fair prospect: but until&#xD;
the towers of Quilipeak rise upon the sight, with their leafy&#xD;
setting of green, there is nothing to draw much notice.&#xD;
And less, afterwards. The train flies on, past numberless&#xD;
stopping posts, over bridges, through towns; regaling its&#xD;
passengers with hay, salt water, bony fish, and. (in the sea-&#xD;
son) dust; until the matchless flats ~~marshes-pOOl5-&#xD;
sights and smells, crowd thick about llaarlem river, and&#xD;
lure the traveller on through the sweet suburbs of New&#xD;
York. Hither business demanded that the "wooden horse"&#xD;
should come for a day or two; here they were to be re-&#xD;
ceived by one of the many old friends who were claiming-&#xD;
all over the country-a visit from Mr. Linden and his&#xD;
bride. Through the dark tunnel the train puffed on, the&#xD;
passengers winking and breathing beneath the air-holes,&#xD;
dark and smothered where air-holes were not; then the&#xD;
cars ran out into the sunlight, and in a minute more two&#xD;
of the passengers were transferred to the easy rolling coach&#xD;
which was in. waiting for them, and drove away. Past&#xD;
warm~ brick fronts and pavements; past radish boys and&#xD;
raspberry girls; past oranges, pineapples, vegetables, in&#xD;
erery degree of freshness except fre~h. Of all which, even&#xD;
the vegetables, Faith's eyes took most curious and intent&#xD;
notic&amp;amp;-.--for one minute; then the Avenue and fruit stalls&#xD;
were left behind; the carriage had turned a corner, and in&#xD;
another minute or two drew ~p before an imposing front&#xD;
in Madison Square. And iA~ere, at the very steps, was a&#xD;
little raspberry girl. low Faith looked at her!&#xD;
"Raspberries to-day, ma'am ?"-said the child, encour-&#xD;
aged by the look, or the sweet face.&#xD;
(400)&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, dear, I don't want any."&#xD;
Faith went gravely up the steps. It was her first intro.&#xD;
auction to New York. But Mr. Linden's face wore a smile.&#xD;
There was no time to remark on it, for the door opened&#xD;
and a second introduction awaited her.. An introduction&#xD;
to another part of the world. A magnificent house, every&#xD;
square yard of which perhaps, taken with its furniture and&#xD;
adornments, had cost as much as the whole of Faith's old&#xD;
home. A palace of luxury, where no want of any kind,&#xD;
material, could be known or fancied. In this house they&#xD;
were welcomed with a great welcome by a stately lady, Mr.&#xD;
Linden's old friend and his mother's; and by her family o*~&#xD;
sons and daughters, who were in another style, and whose&#xD;
vivacious kindness seemed disposed to take up Faith bodily&#xD;
and carry her off. It was a novel scene for Faith, and she&#xD;
was amused. Amused too with the overpowering curiosity&#xD;
which took the guise-or the veil---of so much kindness,&#xD;
and beset her bec~use-.-Mr. Linden had married her. Yet&#xD;
Faith did not see the hundredth part of their curiosity;&#xD;
Mr. Linden whose eyes were more open, was proportionally&#xD;
amused, both with that and with Faith's simplicity, which&#xD;
half gratified and at least half baffled it. The young&#xD;
ladies at last took Faith up to her room; and after lav-&#xD;
ishing all sorts of attentions upon her, and making vari-&#xD;
ous vain efforts to understand her, gave her the informa~&#xD;
tion that a good d6al of company was expected to dinner,&#xD;
~ and left her; baffled and attracted almost in an equal&#xD;
degree.&#xD;
They did not seem to have as puzzling an effect on&#xD;
r~ith; for when Mr. Linden came out of his own dressing&#xD;
~ room, he found her ready and looking as fresh and cool as&#xD;
~ if she haa just come up from the sands at I3aukhead. She&#xD;
was dressed in a light muslin, but no more elaborately than&#xD;
she used to be at Pattaquasset; only that thjs time her&#xD;
ruffles were laces. She was a little more dainty for the&#xD;
dinner-party. Mr. Linden came with a knot of glowing&#xD;
geraniums" Jewess" and "Perfection" and "Queen of&#xD;
the ~'airie4" which, bound together as they were with&#xD;
white ribband, he first laid against her dress to try the&#xD;
effect (well deserving his smile of comment) then put in&#xD;
her hand to make fast. They set off all the quiet el~~&#xD;

gance of her figure after their own style, which was not&#xD;
quiet.&#xD;
"Now Mignonette," he said, "I suppose you know that&#xD;
I am to have the pleasure of introducing my wife to sundry&#xD;
people ?"&#xD;
"I heard they were coming," said Faith.&#xD;
"If you will only stand by and look on, it will amuse&#xD;
you very much."&#xD;
"It will amuse me anyway," said Faith,-" if-" and&#xD;
what a rose colour came up into her face,-" if; Endy, you&#xD;
are satisfied."&#xD;
~ Mr. Linden folded his arms and looked at her. "If you&#xD;
say anything against my wife, Mrs. Linden, her husband&#xD;
will n~ot like it-neither will yours."&#xD;
"That is all I care about-not pleasing those two gen..&#xD;
tlemen," said Faith laughing.&#xD;
"Is that all ?-.-I shall report your mind at rest. Come&#xD;
...-it is time this little exotic should appear." Faith thought&#xD;
as she went with him, that she was anything but an exotic;&#xD;
she did not speak her thoughts.&#xD;
There was a large dinner company gathered and gather-&#xD;
ing; and the "pleasure" Mr. Lind&amp;amp;ii had spoken of-~--intro-&#xD;
ducing his wife-was one enjoyed, by him or somebody, a&#xD;
great many times in the course of the evening. This was&#xD;
something very unlike Pattaquasset or anything to be found&#xD;
there; only in Judge harrison's house little glimpses of&#xD;
this sort of society might be had; and these people seemed&#xD;
to Faith rather in the sphere of Dr. Harrison than of his&#xD;
father and sister. People who had rubbed off every parti-&#xD;
cle of native simplicity that ever belonged to them, and&#xD;
who if they were simple at all..-as some of them were-had&#xD;
a different kind of simplicity, mad~ after a most exquisite&#xD;
and refined worldly fashion. How it was made or worn,&#xD;
Faith could not tell; she had an instinctive feeling of the&#xD;
difference. If she had set on foot a comparison, she would&#xD;
soon have come to the conclusion that "Mr. Linden's&#xD;
wife" was of another pattern altogether. But Faith never&#xD;
thought of doing that. Her words were so true that she&#xD;
had spoken,-she cared so singly to satisfy one person&#xD;
there, and had such an humble confidence of doing it,-&#xD;
that other people gave her little concern. She had little&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
463&#xD;
&#xD;
need, for no word or glance fell upon Faith that did not&#xD;
shew the eye or the speaker won or attracted. The words&#xD;
and glances were very many, but Faith never found out or&#xD;
suspected that it was to see her all this party of grand&#xD;
people l~ad been gathered together. She thought they&#xD;
were curious about "Mr. Linden's wife;" and though their&#xD;
curiosity made her shy, and her sense of responsibility gave&#xD;
an exquisite tenderness to h~er manner, both effects only set&#xD;
a grace upon her usual free simplicity. That was not dis-&#xD;
turbed, though a good deal. of the time Faith was far from&#xD;
Mr. Linden's help or protection. A stranger took her in&#xD;
to dinner, and among strangers she m*mde her way most of&#xD;
the evening. But though she was shy, Faith was afraid&#xD;
never but of one person-nor much of him.&#xD;
For him-among old acquaintances, beset with all man-&#xD;
ner of inquiries and congratulations-he yet heard her&#xD;
voice whenever it was possible, and knew by sight as well&#xD;
as hearing all the admiration she called forth. He might&#xD;
have said as at Kildeer river, that he found "a great deal&#xD;
of Mignonette." What he did tell her, when the evening&#xD;
was over, was that people were at a loss how to name the&#xD;
new exotic.&#xD;
"Row to name me, Endecott ?"&#xD;
"As an exotic. "-.&#xD;
"I don't wonder !" said Faith with her merry little&#xD;
laugh. "Don't philosophers sometimes get puzzled in that&#xD;
way, Endecott ?"&#xD;
"Scientific philosophers content themselves with the&#xD;
hardest names the~y can find, but in this case such will not&#xD;
suit. Though Dr. Campana may write you in his books as&#xD;
'Lindenethia Pattaquassetensis - exotic, very rare. The&#xD;
flower is a double star-colour wonderful !"'&#xD;
Faith stopped to laugh.&#xD;
"What a blunder he will make if he does I" she said.&#xD;
"It will shew-as Mr. Simlins says.-tliat he don't under-&#xD;
stand common vegetables. "&#xD;
"Well translated, Mignonette. How will it shew that,&#xD;
if you please ?"&#xD;
"lie has mistaken one for a trumpet creeper."&#xD;
"A scarlet runner, I suppose."&#xD;
"Was I ?"-said Faith seriously.&#xD;

"According to you. I am in Dr. Campana's predica-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
"I should think you needn't be," said' Faith simply.&#xD;
"Because you know, Endy-I never knew even how to&#xD;
climb, till you showed me."&#xD;
Mr. Linden faced round upon her, the quick flashing eyes&#xD;
answering even more than his "Faith! what do you mean&#xD;
But his lips played then in a rare little smile, as he said,&#xD;
very quietly, in his former position, "Imagine Mignonette,&#xD;
with its full sw6etness-and more than its full colour-sud-&#xD;
denly transplanted to the region where Monkeys and Gera-&#xD;
niums grow,-I like to think of the effect."&#xD;
"I can't think of any effect at all," said Faith. "I should&#xD;
look at the Monkeys and Geraniums 1"-&#xD;
"Of course-being Mignonette. And clearly that you&#xD;
are ;-but then how can INlignonette so twine itself round&#xD;
things ?"&#xD;
Faith thought it did not, and also thought of Pet's charge&#xD;
about "charming;" but she left both points.&#xD;
"Most climbers," said Mr. Linden with a glance at her,&#xD;
"have but one way of laying hold-but this exotic has all.&#xD;
There are the tendrils when it w~ints support, and the close&#xD;
twining that makes of two lives one, and the clasp of a&#xD;
hundred little stems that give a leaf or a flower wherever&#xD;
they touch."&#xD;
"Endecott !"- said Faith with a look of astonished&#xD;
remonstrance and amusement in one.&#xD;
"What?"&#xD;
But the smile and blush with which Faith 'turned away&#xD;
bespoke her not very much displeased; and she knew bet-&#xD;
ter by experience than to do battle with Mr. Linden's words.&#xD;
She let him have it his own way.&#xD;
The'next day business claimed him. Faith was given up&#xD;
to the kindness and curiosity of her new .friends. They&#xD;
made good use of their opportunity, and their opportunity&#xD;
was a good one; for it was not till late in the day, a little&#xD;
while before the late dinner hour, that Mr. Linden came&#xD;
home. He found Faith in her room ;-a superbly appointed&#xD;
chamber, as large as any three of those she h~d been accus~&#xD;

you for a week."                         ad not seen&#xD;
W~ has b9en a long day,".-.--said Faith; who looked&#xD;
rather, it may be remarked, as if the day had freshly&#xD;
begun.&#xD;
"Mignonette, you are perfectly lovely! Do you think&#xD;
you will condescend to wear these flowers ?" said Mr. Liii-&#xD;
den, drawing her to a seat by the table, and with one arm&#xD;
still round her beginning to arrange the flowers he had&#xD;
thrown down there as he came in.&#xD;
Faith watched him, and then looked up.&#xD;
"Endecott-you shouldn't talk to me so. You wouldn't&#xD;
like me to believe you."&#xD;
Mr. Linden finished setting two or three ruby carnations&#xD;
in the green and purple of heliotrope and sweet-scented&#xD;
verbena-then laid the bunch lightly upon her lips and&#xD;
gravely inquired if they were sweet.&#xD;
"Yes,"-.-Faith said, laughing behind them. "You are&#xD;
not hungry ?"&#xD;
/     Why ?-and what of it?"&#xD;
"You don't seem to remember it is near dinner time."&#xD;
"Dinner time is a myth. My dear I am sorry I give&#xD;
you so much uneasiness. I wish you could feel as com-&#xD;
posed about me as I do about you. What have I done&#xD;
with that white ribband !-.--don't stirp-..-.it' is in some pocket&#xD;
or other." And the right one being found, Mr. Linden&#xD;
unwrapped the piece of ribband and cut off what he wanted,&#xD;
remarking that he could n&amp;amp;t get used to giving her anything&#xD;
but blue.&#xD;
"Well, why do you then ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"I feel in a subdued state of mind-..-owing to reproofs,"&#xD;
'I said Mr. Linden, with the white satin curling round his&#xD;
fingers. "I may not tell anybody what I think of my&#xD;
wife!"&#xD;
Faith looked amused, and yet a soft glance left the&#xD;
charge and the 'reproof' standing.&#xD;
"I feel so composed about you".---iMIr. Linden went on,&#xD;
~ drawing his white bows-Faith did think the eyes flashed&#xD;
under the shading lashes,-" so sure that you will never&#xD;

&#xD;
overestimate mo-much less speak of it. But then you&#xD;
know, Mignonette, I never did profess to follow Reason."&#xD;
He was amused to see the little stir his words called up&#xD;
in Faith. He could see it in the changing colour and rest.&#xD;
less eye, and in one look of great beauty which Faith&#xD;
favoured him with. Apparently the shy principle pr~.&#xD;
failed, or Faith's wit got the better o~ her simplicity; for&#xD;
she rose up gravely and laying her hand on the bunch of&#xD;
flowers asked if she should put them on.&#xD;
"Unless you prefer my services."&#xD;
She sat down again immediately, with a face that very&#xD;
plainly preferred them. Half smiling, with fingers that&#xD;
were in no haste about their work, Mr. Linden adjusted&#xD;
the carnations; glancing from them to her, trying them in&#xD;
different positions, playing over his dainty task as if he&#xD;
liked it. The flowers in place, his full smiling look 4et~&#xD;
hers, and she was carried off to the glass "to see his wife."&#xD;
Hardly seen, after all, but by himself.&#xD;
"She looks ready for dinner,".~-said Taith.&#xD;
"Your eyes are only to look at !" said Mr. Linden with&#xD;
a laughing endorsement of his thoughts, and putting her&#xD;
back in the dormouse. "Suppose you sit there and tell&#xD;
me what efforts they have made in the way of seeing, to-&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"Efforts to see all before them-which was more than&#xD;
they could," said Faith.&#xD;
"What did they see ?.-not me, nor I them,-that I&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"That was another sort of effort they made," said Faith&#xD;
smiling-" efforts to see what was not before them. I&#xD;
watched-whenever I thought there was a chance-but I&#xD;
couldn't see anything that looked like you. We must&#xD;
have gone half over the city, Endecott; Mrs. Pulteney&#xD;
took me all the morning, and her daughters and Mr. Pub&#xD;
teney all the afternoon."&#xD;
"Know, 0 little Miguonette," said Mr. Linden, "that in&#xD;
New York it is' 'morning' till those people who dine at six&#xD;
have had their dinner.&#xD;
"Like the swell of some sweet tune&#xD;
Morning rises into noon,&#xD;
was written of country hours."&#xD;
&#xD;
".1 guess that is true of most of the other good things&#xD;
that ever were written7" said Faith.&#xD;
Mr. Linden looked amused. "What do you think of&#xD;
this ?-.&#xD;
&#xD;
'And when the hours of rest&#xD;
Come, like a calm upon the mid-sea brine,&#xD;
Hushing its billowy breast-&#xD;
The quiet of that moment too ~is thine;&#xD;
It breathes of Him who keeps&#xD;
The vast and helpless city while it sleeps.' "~&#xD;
&#xD;
"I never saw the city when it was asleep,~~ said Faith&#xD;
smiling. "It didn't look to-day as if it coi~ld sleep. But,&#xD;
Endecott, II am sure all the pretty part of those words&#xD;
comes from,-where we have been."&#xD;
"The images, yes. But connect any spot of earth with&#xD;
heaven-by any tie-and it must have a certain sort of&#xD;
grandeur. You have been working in brick and mortar&#xD;
to-day, Mignonette,-to-morrow I must give you' a 'bird's-&#xD;
eye view."&#xD;
Faith was silent a minute; and then said, "It don't look&#xD;
a happy place to me, Endecott."&#xD;
"No-it is too human. You want an elm tree or a&#xD;
patch of dandelions between every two houses."&#xD;
"That wouldn't do," said Faith,-" unless the  eople&#xD;
could be less ragged-.~and dirty-~and uneasy; and their&#xD;
houses too. There's nothing like it in Pattaquasset."&#xD;
"I have great confidence in the comforting and civilizing&#xD;
i power of elm trees and green grass," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"But Carlyle says 'Man is not what you can call a happy&#xD;
animal-his appetite for sweet victual is so enormous'; and&#xD;
perhaps New York suffers as much from the fact that&#xD;
everybody wants more, as that some have too little and&#xD;
others too much."&#xD;
"Do these people wailt more ?" said Faith softly.&#xD;
"Without doubt !-.So does everybody in New York-.&#xD;
but me."&#xD;
But why must people do that in New York, when they&#xD;
don't do it in Pattaquasset ?" said Faith, who was very&#xD;
like mignonette at the moment.&#xD;

on one side, but on the other where the hammer' had split&#xD;
it through, the brown face was smooth, and the black leaf&#xD;
lay marked out in all its delicate tracery.&#xD;
"Endecott !-what is this ?".-Faith exclaimed in her low&#xD;
tones of delight.&#xD;
"A fossil leaf."&#xD;
"Of a fern! How beautiful! Where did it come from ~" ~,&#xD;
She had risen in her delight, and stood by Mr. Linden at&#xD;
the dressing-table.&#xD;
"This one from Bohemia. Do you see the perfection of&#xD;
every leaflet ?"&#xD;
"How wonderful-how beautiful," Faith repeated, study.&#xD;
ing the fossil. "It brings up those words, Endecott,-'A&#xD;
thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is&#xD;
past; or as a watch in the night."'&#xD;
"Yes, and these-' The counsel of the Lord, that shall ~&#xD;

"Did your old antiquary send this to me, Endecott ?" she&#xD;
said looking down at it~again.&#xD;

colour that came into her face, different from those of three&#xD;
minutes ago, and the grateful recognition her eyes gave to&#xD;
Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"I don't 'know much more now," she said, in very&#xD;
lowliness,-" about stones---but you can teach me, Ende~&#xD;

don't tell you, and scold me when I do ?"&#xD;
"It's curiosity, I suppose," said Faith. "But it's no&#xD;
matter. I saw all that strange place, Broadway, Endecott;&#xD;
we drove through the whole length of it."&#xD;
"Well?" said Mr. Linden, throWing himself down in&#xD;
the arm-chair and looking gravely up at her. But then&#xD;
the lips parted, not only t6 smile but to sing a wild&#xD;
Scotch tune.&#xD;
"0 wat ye wha that lo'es me,&#xD;

"Did you see anybody like that in Broadway? Faith ?"&#xD;
Blushing-how she blushed !.~-but she would not say a&#xD;
word, nor stir, to interrupt the singing; so she stood there&#xD;
casting a shy look at him now and then till he had stopped,&#xD;
and then coming round behind him she laid her head down&#xD;
upon his shoulder. Mr. Linden laughed, caressing the&#xD;
pretty head in various ways.&#xD;
"My dear little bird !" he said. Then presently-" Mig-&#xD;

"Don't do such a thing again, Endy."&#xD;

was almost taken out ~f New York; and astonished Mr.&#xD;
Pulteney once or twice more in the course of the evening,&#xD;
to Mr. Linden's amusement.&#xD;

CHAPTER XLII.&#xD;
T HE Hudson river railway, on a summer Saturday after-&#xD;
noon. Does everybody know it ?-if not, let me tell&#xD;
the people who have not tried it-.or those more unfortu-&#xD;
nate ones wh~ are tried by it, and driven into the depths of&#xD;
newspapers and brown literature by the steam pressure of&#xD;
mountains, clouds, and river,-.-.that it is glorious. Not on&#xD;
a dusty afternoon,-but when there has been or is a shower.&#xD;
Not the locomotive, or the tender, or the cars-though the&#xD;
long chain has a sort of grandeur, as its links wind into the&#xD;
bays and round the promontories, express. But get a river-&#xD;
side seat, and keep your patience up the lumbered length&#xD;
of Tenth Avenue, and restrain your impatience as the&#xD;
train goes at half stroke along that first bit of road where&#xD;
people are fond of getting on the track,-.watch the other&#xD;
shore, meantime, or the instructive market gardens on this,&#xD;
-then feel the quickened speed, as the engine gets her&#xD;
"head,"-then use your eyes! Open your windows boldly&#xD;
-people don't get cold from our North river air, -never&#xD;
mind the sun-hold up a veil or a fan; only look. See&#xD;
how the shore rises into the Palisades, up which the&#xD;
March of Improvement finds such uncertain footing: how&#xD;
the rising points of hill are rounded with shadow and sun-&#xD;
light, and green from river to crown. See how the clouds&#xD;
roll softly up on the further side-giving showers here and&#xD;
there; how the white-winged vessels sail and careen and&#xD;
float. Look up the river from Peekskill, and see how&#xD;
the hills lock in and part: think of the train of circum-&#xD;
stances that rushed down Arnold's point that long ago&#xD;
morning, where a so different train now passes. Mark the&#xD;
rounding outlines of the green highlands, and as you near&#xD;
Garrisons' let your eye follow the sunbeam that darts down&#xD;
the little mill creek just opposite the tunnel. Then on&#xD;
through those beloved hills, till they fall off right and&#xD;
left, a~vd you are out upon Newbnrgh bay in the full glory&#xD;

catch your eye and hold it.&#xD;
The blue range was a dim outline-hardly that-when&#xD;
Faith reached her journey's end that night. She could&#xD;
hear the dash of the river, and see the brilliant stars, but&#xD;
all details waited for morning. And the rnorfl~ng was&#xD;
Sunday. Balmy, cloudless, the very air put Faith almost&#xD;
in Elysium; and between dreamy enjoyment, and a timid&#xD;
sense of her own new name and position, she would have&#xD;
liked for herself an oriole's nest on one of the high branches.&#xD;
Failing that7 she seemed-as her hostess and again an old&#xD;
friend of Mr. Linden's told him-"like a very rosebud; as&#xD;
sweet, and as much shut, up to herself."&#xD;
Truth to tell, she kept something of the same manner&#xD;
and seeming next day. The house was very full, and of a&#xD;
very gay set of people; of whom Faith's friend, Mr. Mot-&#xD;
ley, was one. Faith. met their advances pleasantly, but she&#xD;
was daintily shy. And besides, the scene and the time&#xD;
were full of temptations to dream over the out of door&#xD;
beauty. The people amused her, but often she would&#xD;
rather have lost them in the hills 6r the sunset; ~nd was&#xD;
for various reasons willing that others should talk while she&#xD;
looked.&#xD;
So passed the first two days; and the third brought an&#xD;
excursion which kept the whole party out till lunch time.&#xD;
But towards the end of the day Mr. Linden was witness to&#xD;
a little drama which let him know something more of Faith&#xD;
than he had just seen before.&#xD;
It was near the time of dressing for dinner. Mr. Linden&#xD;
was already dressed and had come to the library, where in&#xD;
a deep recess on one side of the window he was busy with&#xD;
a piece of study. The window was very large and opened&#xD;
upon a green terrace; and on the terrace in a garden chair,&#xD;
just outside the open window, sat Faith; quietly and in-&#xD;
tensely, he knew, enjoying the broad river* and the mountain&#xD;
range that lay blue in the sunlight a few miles beyond; all&#xD;
in the soft still air of the summer day. She distracted Mr.&#xD;
Linden's thoughts from his study. He could see her per-&#xD;
fectly though he was quite out of her view. She. was in&#xD;
one of the dainty little morning dresses he had sent her&#xD;
from the place of pretty things; nothing could be more&#xD;
&#xD;
* ~s&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
simple, and it suited her; and she, looked about as soft and&#xD;
still as the day. Meanwhile some gentlemen had entered&#xD;
the library and drew near the window. Faith was just out&#xD;
of if eir range and Mr. J4nden was completely hid in his&#xD;
recess, or doubtless their remarks would have had a different&#xD;
bearing. The remarks turned upon Faith, who was here&#xD;
as well as in New York an object of curiosity to those who&#xD;
had known Mr. Linden; and one of the speakers expressed&#xD;
himself as surprised that 'Linden' should have married her.&#xD;
"Wouldn't have thought it ? - would you," said Mr.&#xD;
Motley. "To be sure,-he's able to do all the talking."&#xD;
"She does very well for . the outside," said another.&#xD;
"Might satisfy anybody. Uncommon eyes."&#xD;
"Eyes !" said Mr. Motley. "Yes, she has eyes !-and a&#xD;
mouth. I suppose Linden gets some good of it-if no-.&#xD;
body else does. ~. nd after all, to find a woman that is all&#xD;
eyes and no ton sue, is, as you remark, uncommon."&#xD;
"She's not quite stylish enough for him," said a third.&#xD;
"I thought Linden would have married a brilliant woman."&#xD;
"He'll be a brilliant man, if you tell him that," said Mr.&#xD;
Motley. "Corruscations-and so forth. I never thought&#xD;
I should see him bewitched,-even by a rose leaf monop-&#xD;
oly."&#xD;
The conversation was interrupted. It had not been one&#xD;
which Mr. Linden could very well break; all he could do&#xD;
was to watch Faith. He could see her slightly bent head&#xD;
and still face, and the colour which grew very bright upon the&#xD;
cheek nearest him. She was motionless till the last words&#xD;
were broken off; then, with a shy movement of one hand'&#xD;
to her cheek, covering it, she sprang away, as lightly as any&#xD;
bird she was ever named after. )&#xD;
Mr. Linden was detained in the library, where as the&#xD;
dinner hour drew near other member's of the family began&#xD;
to gather. A group of these were round the table, dis-&#xD;
cussing an engraving; when Mr. Linden saw Faith come&#xD;
in. He was no longer in the dangerous recess; but Faith&#xD;
did not come near him; she joined the party at the table.&#xD;
Mr. Linden watched her. Faith's dressing was always a&#xD;
quiet affair; to-day somehow the effect was very lovely.&#xD;
She wore a soft muslin which flowed about her in full&#xD;
draperies; with a breast-knot of roses on its white folds.&#xD;

Faith rarely put on flowers that Mr. Linden had not given&#xD;
her. To-day was an exception; and her white robe with no&#xD;
setting off but those roses and her rich hair, was faultless.&#xD;
Not merely that; the effect was too striking to be abso-&#xD;
lutely quiet; all eyes were drawn to her.&#xD;
The gentlemen whom she had heard speak were among&#xD;
the party; and no eyes were more approving. Mr. Linden&#xD;
watched, as he might, without being seen to watch. Faith&#xD;
joined not only the party, but the conversation; taking her&#xD;
place in it frankly; showing no unwilling ~ness to give opin..&#xD;
ions or to discuss them, and no desire to avoid any subject&#xD;
that ca~me up. She was taking a new stand among these&#xD;
strangers, Mr. Linden saw it, and he could guess the secret&#xD;
reason; no one else could guess that there was anything to&#xD;
give a reason for, so &amp;amp;olIy, so naturally, it was done. But&#xD;
the stand was taken. Faith had not stepped in the least&#xD;
out of her own bounds; she had abated not a whit of her&#xD;
extreme modesty. She was never more herself; only it was&#xD;
as if she had laid down a self-indulgent shyness which she&#xD;
had permitted herself before, and allowed Mr. Linden's&#xD;
friends to become~ acquainted with Mr. Linden's wife. ~ut&#xD;
with herself! Her manner to-day was exceedingly like her&#xD;
dress; the plainest simplicity, the purest quality, and the&#xD;
roses~ blushing over all. It fascinated the gentlemen, every&#xD;
one of them. They found that the little demure piece of&#xD;
gravity could talk; and talk with a truth and freshness of&#xD;
thought too, which was like the rest of her, uncommon and&#xD;
interesting, soft and free at once. Faith went off to dinner&#xD;
on the arm of one of her maligners, and was very busy with&#xD;
company all the evening after, having little to do with Mr.&#xD;
Linden.&#xD;
She had escaped to her room earlier than he, however;&#xD;
and when he came in she was sitting thoughtfully before the&#xD;
open window. She rose up directly and came to him, with&#xD;
the usual smile, and with a little hidden triumph dancing in&#xD;
her eyes, and an odd wistful look besides of affection and&#xD;
humility. She only came close to him for a caress, without&#xD;
speaking. Mr. Linden took her face in both hands and&#xD;
looked at it-a beautiful smile mingling with the somewhat&#xD;
moved look of his own.&#xD;
"What a child you are !"&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
The colour rushed all over Faith's cheeks.&#xD;
"Why ? -" she whispered. The answer to which,&#xD;
~ cheeks and brow and lips might spell out as best they&#xD;
could.&#xD;
"Do you know ~hy I did not come with your flowers,&#xD;
Mignonette ?"&#xD;
"Before dinner ?-no. I got some for myself."&#xD;
"I was on my way for them, and was entrapped and held&#xD;
fast. My little Mignonette 1-I never thought to have you&#xD;
put your hand to your cheek in that way again !"&#xD;
"Again, Endecott ! .-Who told you ?"~-said Faith, as&#xD;
usual jumping to conclusions.&#xD;
"Who told me what, my beauty ?"&#xD;
Faith's eye fell in doubt, then looked up searchingly.&#xD;
"I believe you know everything; but you don't look dis~&#xD;
pleased. How did you know, Endecott ?"&#xD;
I saw and heard. And have seen and heard siribe," ho&#xD;
~ added smiling.&#xD;
A question or two found out exactly how it had been;&#xD;
and then Faith put the inquiry, simple to quaintness~ "Did&#xD;
I do better to-day ?"&#xD;
"If you are so anxious for mc-" he said stroking back&#xD;
her hair. "They did not deserve to have one of my wife's&#xD;
words,-but her words were admirable."&#xD;
It was worth while to *see Faith's cheeks.&#xD;
"Will you trust me to ride with Mr. Middleton to-mor-&#xD;
row ?" she asked presently, smiling.&#xD;
"No-.Yes----I will trust you but not him."&#xD;
"Does that mean that you will trust me to go ?"&#xD;
"Not with him."&#xD;
"But what shall I do ?" said Faith flushing after a dif-&#xD;
ferent fashion-half laughing too-" I told him I would go,&#xD;
or that I thought I would go."&#xD;
"Tell him that you think you will not."&#xD;
Faith looked a little troubled; she foresaw a charge of&#xD;
questions she did not like to meet.&#xD;
"Are you afraid of the horse, Endy ?" she said after a&#xD;
pause, a little timidly.&#xD;
"No, darling."&#xD;
Faith was pretty; just now, as she stood with her eyes&#xD;
cast down; like a generous tempered horse first feeling the&#xD;

&#xD;
bit; you can see that the creature will be as docile as pos.&#xD;
sible, yet he is a little shy of your curb. Anything like&#xD;
conti~ol was absolutely new to her; and though her face&#xD;
was never more absolutely sweet, there was with that a&#xD;
touch of embarrassment which made an inexpressibly pretty&#xD;
mixture. Mr. Linden might well be amused and touched,&#xD;
and charmed too1 all in one.&#xD;
"Mr. Motley asked me to ride too,".-she said after a&#xD;
minute, blushing a little deeper, and speaking as if it were&#xD;
a supplement to her former words. "lie wanted to show&#xD;
me the Belle Spring. I had better' gi~e them both the&#xD;
same answer,"&#xD;
"Has nobody else preferred his request ?-.-they are just&#xD;
the two people with whom I do not want you to rides" said&#xD;
Mr. Linden smiling. "I shall have to ask you myself-or&#xD;
claim you. Mrs. Linden, may I have the honour ?"-Faith&#xD;
gave him a very bright answer of a smile, but with a little&#xD;
secret wish in her heart that the other people had not asked&#xD;
her.&#xD;
Her denial however was perfectly well taken by Mr.&#xD;
Motley; not indeed without a little bantering talk and&#xD;
raillery upon the excessive care Mr. Linden bestowed on&#xD;
her. But Mr. Middleton, she saw, was not pleased that she&#xD;
disappointed him. Within two or three days Faith had&#xD;
become unmistakably the centre of attraction to all the&#xD;
gentlemen of the neighbourhood. To. walk with her, to&#xD;
talk to her, to attend upon her, were not a coveted honour&#xD;
merely, but a coveted pleasure. It was found wonderfully&#xD;
refreshing to talk to Faith: her eyes were something pleas.&#xD;
ant to look at, for more than George Alc~ott; and the truth&#xD;
of hei~ enjoyment and gratitude made it a captivating thing&#xD;
to be the means of exciting them.&#xD;
Mr. Middleton was one of those men who think very much&#xD;
indeed of the value of their approbation, and never bestow&#xD;
I&#xD;
it but where they are sure the honour of their taste and&#xD;
judgment is like to be the gainer. One of th6se men who&#xD;
in ordinary keep their admiration for themselves, and he-.&#xD;
stow in that quarter a very large amount. Faith's refusal&#xD;
to ride with him touched him very disagreeably. It was&#xD;
impossible to be offended with her. But perhaps all the&#xD;
more ~ie was offended with somebody; and it happened un-&#xD;
&#xD;
478&#xD;
&#xD;
luckily that some reported light words of Mr. Motley about&#xD;
M~. Linden's care of his wife and especial distrust of the&#xD;
gentlemen who had asked her to ride, reached Mr. Middle-.&#xD;
ton's ear in a very exaggerated and opprobrious form. Mr.&#xD;
Middleton did not know Mr. Linden, nor know much of&#xD;
him; his bottled-up wrath resolved that Mr. Linden should&#xD;
not continue long in his reciprocal ignorance. And so it&#xD;
fell out, that as this week began with showing Mr. Linden&#xD;
something of Faith that he had not seen before, it did not&#xD;
end without giving her a new view of him.&#xD;
Jt was a captivating summer morning when the cavalcade&#xD;
set forth from Rye House, on a picnic to Alderney-one of&#xD;
the show places in the neighbourhood. It seemed fairyland&#xD;
to Faith. The beautiful country over which they travelled, in&#xD;
summer's luxuriance of grass and grain ;-the river rolling&#xD;
below at a little* distance, sometimes hidden only to burst&#xD;
upon the view again ;-and towering above all, unchanged&#xD;
beyond the changing lights and shades of the nearer&#xD;
landscape, the long mountain range. The air was perfec-&#xD;
tion; the sounds of voice and laughter and horses'.brisk&#xD;
feet helped the exhilaration, and the lively colours and&#xD;
fashion of caps and habits and feathers made pretty work&#xD;
for the eye. Faith's ears and eyes were charmed. At a&#xD;
cross road the party was joined by Mr. Middleton; whose&#xD;
good-humour, at present in a loose-jointed state, was noise&#xD;
improved at the sight of Faith. She rode then, at any&#xD;
rate; and she sat well and rode fearlessly, that he could see;&#xD;
and his eye, keen for such things, noted too the neat ap-&#xD;
pointments of her dress, and saw that they were all right&#xD;
and fitted her and she fitted them; and that her figure alto-,&#xD;
gether was what no man might dislike to have beside him,&#xD;
even a man so careful of his appearance as Mr. Middleton.&#xD;
Not near Faith did he come; but having noted all these&#xD;
things with gathering ire, lie sheered off to another part&#xD;
of the troop.&#xD;
It was a pretty day to Faith, the whole first part of it.&#xD;
The ride, and the viewing the grounds they went to see.&#xD;
These were indeed naturally very noble; and to Faith's&#xD;
eyes every new form of natural beauty, of which her range&#xD;
had hitherto been so very small, was like a fresh draught&#xD;
of water to thirsty lips. It was a great draught she&#xD;

had this morning, and ei~joyed almost to the forgetful.&#xD;
ness of everything else. Then came the lunch. And that&#xD;
was picturesque too, certainly; on such a bank, under such&#xD;
trees, with such a river and mountains in front; and Faith&#xD;
enjoyed it and them so' far. But it was splendid too, and&#xD;
noisy; and her thoughts went at one time away very far, to&#xD;
iKildeer river, and remembered a better meal taken under&#xD;
the trees, with better talk, and only, Bob Tuck to look at&#xD;
them. She stole a glance at Mr. Linden. He was doing&#xD;
his part and making somebody very comfortable indeed..-..&#xD;
Faith half smiled to see it.&#xD;
Mr. MiddletOn at another part of the assembled com-&#xD;
pany, had been getting his temper up with wine and his ill&#xD;
humour with the various suggestions and remarks of some&#xD;
careless gossipers at his side. Finding that he winced&#xD;
under the mention of Mrs. Linden and the ride, they gave&#xD;
him that subject with as many variations as the Katydid&#xD;
polka,-the simple "She did "-(or rather "She didn't ")&#xD;
-skilfully diversified and touched up,-which brought Mr.&#xD;
Middleton's heavy Piece of displeasure, already primed,&#xD;
loaded, and at full cock, to the very point where his temper&#xD;
struck fire. He leTt the table and drew towards Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den, who was talking in the midst of a group of ladies&#xD;
and gentlemen. Middleton knew which was he - that&#xD;
was all.&#xD;
"You, sir !"-he said like a surly bull-dog-which term&#xD;
describes both his mental and physical features,-" my&#xD;
name's MiddLeton-J want you to take back what you've&#xD;
said about me&#xD;
Mr. Linden at the moment was in the full tide of Ger-&#xD;
man talk with one of his old fellow students from abroad; his&#xD;
excellent poise and play of conversation and manner setting&#xD;
off the gesticulations of the foreigner. WTith a look of&#xD;
more surprise than anything else he brought eyes and&#xD;
attention to bear upon Mr. Middleton.&#xD;
"What, sir?" he said.&#xD;
"Will you take back what you've said about me ?".-..The&#xD;
dogged wrath of the man was beyond the use of many&#xD;
words, to which indeed he was never given.&#xD;
"I have not said anything, sir, which requires that."&#xD;
And with a bend of the head-cool and courteous as his&#xD;
&#xD;
words-Mr. Linden dismissed the subject; and placing&#xD;
himself on the grass with his friend and some others, fell&#xD;
back into the Germat~. Middleton followed fuming.&#xD;
"I've come to speak to you !"-he said, beginning with&#xD;
an execration,-" and you must get up and answer me.&#xD;
Will you take back what you said ?" Stooping down, he&#xD;
had thrown these words into Mr. Linden's car in a way to&#xD;
leave no doubt whom they were meant for.&#xD;
"I have answered you, sir."&#xD;
"That is to tell you what I think of it !"-said Middle~&#xD;
ton, dashing in his face the remains of a glass of wine&#xD;
which he had brought with him from the board on purpose.&#xD;
He was on his feet then !-with what a spring !-as in&#xD;
the fairy tale the beautiful princess of a sudden became a&#xD;
sword. Just such eyes of fire Mr. Middleton had never&#xD;
been privileged to see. But Faith saw the hands drop and&#xD;
grasp each other,-she saw the eyes fall, and the colour go&#xD;
and come and go again, with a rush and swiftness that was&#xD;
startling to see. Absolutely motionless-the very breath&#xD;
kept down,-so he stood. And- even his assailant gazed,&#xD;
in a sort of spell-bound wonder. The twittering birds&#xD;
overhead, how they carolled; how softly the leaves rustl~d,&#xD;
and the riVer sent up its little waves: and the sunshine and&#xD;
shadow crept on, measuring off the seconds. The pure&#xD;
peace and beauty of everything-the hush of human voices&#xD;
-were but the setting of the deep human struggle. The&#xD;
victory came.&#xD;
With a face from which at last the colour had~ taken its&#xD;
permanent departure, Mr. Linden looked up and spoke:&#xD;
and something made the very low tones ring in the air.&#xD;
"I have said nothing about you which needed apology,&#xD;
Mr. Middleton. You have been misinformed, sir." And&#xD;
with that same bend of dismissal Mr. Linden drew himself&#xD;
up and walked away, bareheaded as he was. The trees hi~l&#xD;
him in a moment.&#xD;
Then there came a stir.&#xD;
"What a coward !" cried George Alcott, pressing for-&#xD;
ward,-" to do that to a man who you knew wouldn't knock&#xD;
you down 1"&#xD;
The young German had started up, sputtering strange&#xD;
things in his native tongue.&#xD;

&#xD;
"Mr. Linden is an excellent commentator!" said one&#xD;
young lady, who took the liberty of speech pretty freely.&#xD;
"How clear he makes it that 'The discretion of a man&#xD;
deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass by a trans.&#xD;
gression !'"&#xD;
"I really thought," said Mr. Motley in a make-believe&#xD;
whisper, "when Middleton first came up, that he had been&#xD;
taking a glass too much,-but now I see that he took just&#xD;
halt' a glass too little !"&#xD;
"Sir," said Colonel Rye stepping forward, a man of&#xD;
most noble character and presence both, "Mr. Linden is&#xD;
my guest andfriend-you must answer this to me."&#xD;
Before Mr. Middleton could make answer, Faith had&#xD;
come in between and laid hold of the Colonel's hanl. She&#xD;
was white, and quiet, but she could not at once speak. All&#xD;
around stood still.&#xD;
"Sir," she said, in words that were well heard for every.&#xD;
body held his breath,-" Colonel Rye-this is Mr. Linden's&#xD;
affair."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, my dear young lady-it is mine."&#xD;
"No sir," said Faith-.--he felt how eagerly her fingers&#xD;
c'asped his-"it is in Mr. Linden's hands. He forgives&#xD;
Mr. Middleton entirely."&#xD;
"I don't forgive him !" said the Colonel shortly.&#xD;
"Sir," said Faith,-" Colonel Rye-this is not what Mi'.&#xD;
Linden would wish. Endecott will tell you, sir, that he has&#xD;
passed it by. Don't undo what he has done! No true&#xD;
friend of Mr. Linden will make any more of this."&#xD;
"I am willing to answer it to anybody,"-said Middleton&#xD;
gruffly, but as if half ashamed of himself.&#xD;
"There is nothing to answer to any one," said Faith&#xD;
quitting the Colonel and turning to him; her face was so&#xD;
white and gentle that it smote him, and those very steady&#xD;
sweet eyes had a power in them just now that broke his&#xD;
doggedness. "There is nothing to answer to any one-&#xD;
unless, Mr. Middleton-" (how soft her voice was)-" un*&#xD;
less you find you were wrong, and choose to tell Mr.&#xD;
Linden-which I daresay you will. Colonel Rye-will&#xD;
you see-for Mr. Linden's honour-that this goes to no&#xD;
harm ?"&#xD;
The extreme gentleness and the steady firmness of Faith&#xD;
&#xD;
* ruled them all; and at her last appeal the Colonel's only&#xD;
answer was to take her in his arms and kiss her-an ac~&#xD;
knowledgment Faith would willingly have gone without.&#xD;
But it was good for a promise.&#xD;
"Mr. Alcott," she said seeking him in the group,-.&#xD;
"you said we would go down the bank-" Faith did not&#xD;
finish her sentence, but he saw her wish to finish it by&#xD;
action.&#xD;
She went with him till they were out of sight and away&#xD;
from everybody; then slipped her arm from his and begging&#xD;
him not to wait for her sat down on the grass. For a while&#xD;
she sat very still,-whether her heart was fuller of petition&#xD;
or thanksgiving she hardly knew. She would have rejoined&#xD;
Mr. Alcott much sooner if she had guessed he was waiting&#xD;
for her--like an outpost among the trees; but all the time&#xD;
had not brought back Faith's cQlOur. After a while, other&#xD;
steps came swiftly over the turf as she sat there, and before&#xD;
she had raised her head it was lifted up for her.&#xD;
"My precious wife !-what are you doing here ?"--Very&#xD;
low the tones were, very grave, very tender.&#xD;
Faith sprang, and after an exploring glance into his&#xD;
face, knelt on the grass beside him, and threw her arms&#xD;
round his neck, pressing her cheek very close as if she would&#xD;
take off or share the affront that had been offered to his.&#xD;
That for a minute-and then changing characters-she&#xD;
raised her head and pushing the hair back from his brow&#xD;
With her soft hurried fingers, she covered that and hi~ face&#xD;
~ with kisses-with a kind of eager tenderness that could not&#xD;
~ say enough nor put enough love and reverence into every&#xD;
touch. All this while she was still; she did not shed tears&#xD;
at all, as some women would have done; and she said not&#xD;
one word.&#xD;
Perhaps surprise made him passive: perhaps the sooth-&#xD;
ing of her caresses was too sweet and too much needed to&#xD;
be interrupted, even by a return. He let her have her. way,&#xD;
nor even raised his eyes. One arm indeed was~ round her,&#xD;
but it left her free to do what she liked. If Faith needed&#xD;
any light on what the morning's work had been, it was fur-&#xD;
nished by those few minutes. Only at last, with a sudden&#xD;
notion Mr. Linden brought her lips to his, and gave her&#xD;
back principal and interest.&#xD;

&#xD;
'You blessed child !" he said. "Are you a veritable&#xD;
angel already ?"&#xD;
"I should have brought you a palm-branch, Endy "~&#xD;
For almost the first time he had ever heard it so, Faith's&#xD;
voice was unsteady.&#xD;
Had she not done it ?-Mr. Linden did not say so, as ho&#xD;
took grave note of her pale cheeks. Presently rising up&#xD;
he passed his ann round her, and took her up the bank to&#xD;
the rest of the party, nor let go his hold till she was seated&#xD;
between Mrs. Rye and himself. Then from the fern leaf in&#xD;
his hand, he proceeded to give them both an account of&#xD;
ferns in general-living and fossil, extant and extinct; with&#xD;
his usual happy skill and interest, and-except that the lips&#xD;
never broke into a smile-with just his usual manner. And&#xD;
never had the grave depth of eye been more beautiful, more&#xD;
clear. Not Faith alone watched it with loving admiration,&#xD;
but no one any more than she ventured word or look of&#xD;
sympathy.&#xD;
When at last the various groups began to draw in&#xD;
towards a centre, and ladies put on their riding hats, and&#xD;
grooms were buckling girths again, Mr. Middleton with&#xD;
two or three others was seen advancing towards Mr. Lin.&#xD;
den's quarter. Mrs. Rye rose hastily.&#xD;
"I am sorry to find that I made a mistake, sir," said&#xD;
Middleton with a sort of unwilling courtesy.-" I was under&#xD;
misinformation-and I was not aware of your profession.&#xD;
I beg your pardon for what has occurred."&#xD;
Mr. Linden had risen too, and with folded arms and&#xD;
the most unmoved face stood watching the party as they&#xD;
came up..&#xD;
"It is granted--." he said offering his hand. "But permit&#xD;
me to say, Mr. Middleton, that you made a third mistake,&#xD;
equally great if the other two had not existed."&#xD;
Mr. MiJdleton's private thoughts were perhaps not&#xD;
clearly disentangled. At all events he had no desire to&#xD;
multiply words, and turned off'.&#xD;
"So7 he has spoken, has he !" said Colonel Rye coming&#xD;
up. "Like a bear, I dare say. Why do you think I didn't&#xD;
fight him, Endecott ?"&#xD;
A smile came over Mr. Linden's face then-bright and&#xD;
stirred.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I think, sir, you yielded to Mignonette's power,-as [&#xD;
did long ago."&#xD;
"You ?.-Did he ?" said the Colonel turning.~&#xD;
" {o, sir-never !"-said Faith, laughing and blushing&#xD;
till her cheeks were brilliant. The Colonel smiled at her.&#xD;
"My dear," said he, "you conquered me !-and I don't&#xD;
believe any other man more invincible than myself. Is this&#xD;
your horse ?-No, Motley-no, George-she is going to&#xD;
have an old cavalier for her ride home."&#xD;
And much to Faith's pleasure, so she had.&#xD;

C PTER XLIII.&#xD;
O CTOBER'S foliage had lost its distinct red and purple&#xD;
and brown, and had grown merely sunburnt; but the&#xD;
sky overhead still keiit its wonderful blue. Down the&#xD;
ravines, over their deep shadow, October breathed softly;&#xD;
up the mountain road, past grey boulders and primeval&#xD;
trees and wonderful beds of moss, went the stage wagon.&#xD;
The travellers were going by a somewhat long and ~irre.&#xD;
gular route, first up one of the great highways, then&#xD;
across to that spur of the mountains where they were to&#xD;
live. Mrs. Derrick was to follow in a few weeks with Mr.&#xD;
Stoutenburgh.&#xD;
It was late and dusky when the sLa~ge wagon transferred&#xD;
the travellers to Mr. Olyphant's carriage which was waiting&#xD;
fQr them at a certain turn of the road. Mr. Olyphant&#xD;
himself was there, with extra wrappings for Faith; and&#xD;
muffled in them she sat leaning in the corner of the&#xD;
carriage, tired enough to in ake the rest pleasant~ awake&#xD;
enough to hear the conversation; feeling more like a bird&#xD;
than ever, with that unwanted night air upon her face, and&#xD;
the wild smell of woods and evergreens and brooks floating&#xD;
about her.&#xD;
At Mr. Olyphant's they were received with warm wood&#xD;
fires and excellent supper, the welcome spending itself iii&#xD;
many other ways. But though Mi'. Linden did take her to&#xD;
the door for one minute to hear a pouring mountain tor.&#xD;
rent, she could see nothing that night. The stars overhead&#xD;
were brilliant, the dark hill outline dim,-.the rushing of&#xD;
that stream-how it sounded! Faith's whisper was glee.&#xD;
ful.&#xD;
"Endy.-I can't see much~-but it feels lovely !-J am so&#xD;
glad to be here&#xD;
The morning was wonderful. Such a sunlight, such an&#xD;
air, such rejoicing of birds and brook and leaves. Mr.&#xD;
Olyphant's house stood on one side of a woody slope, rocks&#xD;
(486)&#xD;
&#xD;
S~.Y AND SEAL.487&#xD;
and trees crowned to the very top; in the ravine below, the&#xD;
rook Faith had heard. She could see it now, foaming&#xD;
along, quieting itself as it came into smoother circum~&#xD;
stances. The most of its noise indeed seemed to be made&#xD;
in some place out of sight, higher up. This slope was not&#xD;
very high, other ridges before and beyond it looked down--&#xD;
not frowningly, in their October dress. Not much else&#xD;
could be seen, it was a mere leafy nest. A little faint line&#xD;
of smoke floated over the opposite ridge, glimpses of moun~&#xD;
tam paths here and there caught the sunlight, below Faith's&#xD;
window Mr. Linden stood, like some statue, with folded&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
Faith hastily finished her dressing. As soon as that&#xD;
was done she knelt at her window again, to look and to&#xD;
pray. Those hills looked very near the sky ;-life~work&#xD;
there seemed almost to touch heaven. Nay, did it not?&#xD;
Heaven bent over th9 glorious earth and over the work to&#xD;
be ~done there, with the same clear, fair, balmy promise and&#xD;
truth. Faith could almost have joined the birds in their&#xD;
singing; her heart did; and her heart's singing was as&#xD;
pure and as grave as theirs. Not the careless glee that&#xD;
~ sees and wants nothing but roses in the way; but the dee~&#xD;
~ love and gladness, both earthly and heavenly, that makes&#xD;
roses grow out of every soil. So she looked, when Mr.&#xD;
Linden first discerned her, venturing from the hall door&#xD;
and searching round for him.&#xD;
"0 little Sunbeam !"-.--he said, "how you 'glint' upon&#xD;
everything !-there is a general illumination when you&#xD;
~. come out of the door. low do you feel this morning ?-&#xD;
"As if I never had been tired. "-And Faith might have&#xD;
said, as if she never would be tired again; but only her&#xD;
eye revelled in such soft boasting. "Where is our home,&#xD;
now, Endecott?"&#xD;
The ridge before them, on the other side of the ravine,&#xD;
rose up with swifter ascent into the blue air and looked&#xD;
even more thick set with forest trees: but where it slanted&#xD;
down towards the more open country, a little break in the&#xD;
trees spoke of clearing and meadow and cultivation. The&#xD;
clearing was for the most part on the other side, but a bit&#xD;

&#xD;
of one green field, dotted with two or three dark objects,&#xD;
swept softly over the ridge line.&#xD;
"Are you in the sight-seeing mood ?" said Mr. Linden,&#xD;
with a look as gladsonw as her own.&#xD;
"Yes !.--and seeing sights too. But where is that,&#xD;
Endy ?"&#xD;
"I shall take you there by degrees-.--wait a moment,"&#xD;
and he went in for the glass. "Now, Mignon ette," he said,&#xD;
adjusting it for her, "I wish to ask your notice for a little&#xD;
black spot on that bit of clearing. But first what does it&#xD;
look like to you.-.-.-a hut or a summerhouse ?"&#xD;
"Jt's too far off--it looks like nothing but a black&#xD;
spot."&#xD;
"No~v look-" said Mr. Linden smiling. 0 wondroJs&#xD;
power of the glass !-the black spot remained indeed a&#xD;
black spot still, but with the improvements of very de.&#xD;
cided horns, black tail, and four feet.&#xD;
"'Somebody lives there," said Faith. "It's a cow."&#xD;
"Most true! What cow do you suppose it is, Mrs.&#xD;
Linden ?"&#xD;
Faith put down her glass to laugh at him. "It's no&#xD;
friend of mine," she said. "I have a few friends among&#xD;
cows, but not many."&#xD;
"My dear Mrs. Linden, you always were rather quick at&#xD;
conclusions. If you look again, you will see that the cow&#xD;
has a surrounding fence of primeval roots, which will keep&#xD;
even her from running away."&#xD;
Faith obeyed directions, carefully. "Endy-.--" she said&#xD;
in an oddly changed tone, "is it my black heifer ?"&#xD;
"It is not mine," said Mr. Linden.&#xD;
"But I didn't know she had come !"-said Faith; then&#xD;
putting up her glass again to scan the far-off 'black spot'&#xD;
and all around it, with an intenseness of feeling which&#xD;
showed itself in two very different spots on her cheeks.&#xD;
"Put down your glass, Faith," said Mr. Linden, "and&#xD;
look up along the ridge to that faint blue wreath over the&#xD;
yellow t~ree-tops,-...-.that is your first welcome from my&#xD;
study."&#xD;
She looked eagerly, and then a most delighted bright&#xD;
smile broke over her face as it turned to Mr. Linden.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I-Tow do you know it is in your study, Endecott ?-.-.-and&#xD;
wh~ has lighted it ?"&#xD;
~ "Some one !-.--AVe'll go over after breakfast and see."&#xD;
~At breakfast many things were discussed besides broiled&#xD;
chicken. And afterwards there came to the door two&#xD;
of the rugged, surefooted, mountain horses, saddled and&#xD;
bridled for the expedition. On the porch steps a great&#xD;
1uu~h basket told of Mrs. Olyphant's care-Faith was up&#xD;
stairs donning her habit. Mr. Linden ran up to meet&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Faith," he said laughingly, "Malthus has just confided&#xD;
to me, that 'if Mrs. Endecott has any things to take over,'&#xD;
they would make tfrn way wonderfully pleasant to him."&#xD;
"Who is Malthus ?"&#xD;
The shy blush on Faith's cheek was pretty to see.&#xD;
"He is an old servant of mine, who has been with Mr.&#xD;
Olyphant and is coining to me agah~."&#xD;
Faith thought it was good news, and as good for Mal-&#xD;
thus as anybody! An important little travelling bag was&#xD;
committed to him, and the ca4alcado set forth.&#xD;
The way was far longer than the distance seemed to pro-&#xD;
mise, having to follow the possibilities of the ground. A wild&#xD;
way-through the forest and over the brook; a good bridle&#xD;
path, but no better. The stillness of nature everywhere;&#xD;
rarely a human habitation near enough to afford human&#xD;
sounds. Frost and dew lay sparkling yet on moss and&#xD;
~ stone, in the dells where the sun had not looked; though&#xD;
~. now and then a sudden opening or turn showed a reach or&#xD;
a gorge of the mountains all golden with sunlight. Trees&#xD;
such as FaIth had never seen stood along the path in many&#xD;
places, and under them the horses' footfalls frightened the&#xD;
squirrels from tree to tree.&#xD;
"Is this the only way of getting about here, Ende..&#xD;
~ cott?"&#xD;
"This or on foot-in many directions. That part of&#xD;
our parish which lies below us, as Mr. Olyphant says,&#xD;
can be reached with wheels. But look, Mignonette! "&#xD;
The road turned sharply round a great boulder, and they&#xD;
were almost home! There it lay before them, a little&#xD;
below,-....an irregular, low, grey stone cottage, fitting itself&#xD;
to the ground as if fitting the ground to it had been an&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb  n="490-491" xml:id="VAC8220-00000246"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
impossibility. It was not on a ravine; the slope wer~&#xD;
down, down, till it swept off into the stubble fields and&#xD;
eIeaed land below. There was the sound of a great&#xD;
waterfall in the distance, close by the house a little branch&#xD;
stream went bounding down, and spread itself out peace.&#xD;
ably in the valley. Dark hemlocks guarded the cottage&#xD;
from too close neighbourhood of the cliffs at the back, but&#xD;
in front the subsiding roughness of nature kept only a few&#xD;
oaks and maples here and there. The cleared ground was&#xD;
irregular, like the house, running up and down, as might&#xD;
be. No moving thing in sight but the blue smoke and the&#xD;
sailing clouds and cloud shadows. The tinkle of a cow-&#xD;
bell made itself heard faintly-the breeze rushed through&#xD;
the pines, then slowly the black heifer came over the brow&#xD;
of her meadow and surveyed the prospect.&#xD;
Faith had checked her horse, and looking at it all, up&#xD;
and down, turned to Mr. Linden. There was a great deal&#xD;
in her look, more than words could bear the burden of, and&#xD;
she said none. He held out his hand and clasped hers&#xD;
speakingly, the lips unbent then, though they went back to&#xD;
the grave lines of thought and interest and purpose. It&#xD;
was not merely his home he was looking at-it was the one&#xD;
to which he was bringing her. Was it the place for Mig.&#xD;
nonette ?-would it be too lonely, too cold? or was the&#xD;
whole scene that lay before them, in its Wild beauty, the&#xD;
roughness covered and glorified by that supreme sunlight,&#xD;
a fair picture of their life together-wherever it might be?&#xD;
So he believed; the light grew and deepened in his own&#xD;
eyes as he looked,.-the grave purpose, the sure hope ; and&#xD;
Mignonette's little hand the while was held as she had&#xD;
rarely felt him hold it before.&#xD;
Presently she bent down so that she could look up in&#xD;
his face, answering him then with a smile.&#xD;
"Endy-what are you thinking of ?-I am very happy."&#xD;
* The last words were lowered a little.&#xD;
Mr. Linden's eyes came to her instantly, with something&#xD;
of their former look but very bright; and bending off his&#xD;
horse he put one arm round her, with as full and, earnest a&#xD;
kiss as she had ever had from him. "That is what I was&#xD;
thinking of," he said. "I was thinking of my wife, Mig-&#xD;
nonette."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Aren't you satisfied?" she said in her former tone.&#xD;
"Perfectly!-"&#xD;
The look made a very personal application.&#xD;
Faith shook her head a little and they rode on.&#xD;
The cottage door was very near presently; Faith coul~1&#xD;
see all the minor points of interest. Maithus who had got&#xD;
there by a short cut, waited to take their horses-then a&#xD;
white cap and apron appeared in the doorway for a second&#xD;
and vanished again.&#xD;
"You will find another of our old de y~endants here,&#xD;
Faith," said Mr. Linden. '7&#xD;
"Who is that ?" she said quickly.&#xD;
"There were three women in our house," said Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den? "that Pet and I called respectively, 'Good7' 'Better,'&#xD;
'Best,'-this is Best.. Hers was a name in earnest? for we&#xD;
never called her anything else; and it was always th~ de-&#xD;
sire of h~r heart first to see my wife and then to live with&#xD;
her. And~ I was sure she would please you."&#xD;
"What must I call her ?-Mrs. Best ?" said Faith.&#xD;
"No, you must call her nothing but 'Best.'"&#xD;
"That's excellent !" said Faith gleefully. "I tho~gbt&#xD;
there was nobody here but one friend of yours, Endecott.&#xD;
- Now I shall get in order directly."&#xD;
"That is what you thought you were coming to !" he&#xD;
said coming to her side to lift her down. "How would&#xD;
you like to be taken right back to Mr. Olyphant's ?"&#xD;
"Not at all 1"-&#xD;
*    In answer to which she was lightly jumped down from&#xD;
the saddle .and carried off into the house; where Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den and Best shook hands after a prolonged fashion, and&#xD;
the old servant-not that she was very old neither-turned&#xD;
glad and eager and respectful eyes upon her new mistress,&#xD;
touching that little hand with great satisfaction of heart.&#xD;
"It's warmer in the study, sir,'7 she said, "and there's a&#xD;
fire in the kitchen-if Mrs. Endecott would like to see&#xD;
that. And shall I make one anywhere else, ma'am ?"&#xD;
Best's white cap and apron were very attractive; and so&#xD;
on the other hand were Faith's blush and smile.&#xD;
The hall in which they stood-rather a wide one, cut&#xD;
the house from front to back, with no break of stair-&#xD;
way. Through the opcn back door Faith could see the&#xD;

&#xD;
dark clift' and hear the brook. Mr. Linden asked where&#xD;
"she would go first ?" Faith whispered, "To the study."&#xD;
lie smiled, and opened the one door at her left hand and&#xD;
led her in.&#xD;
Not yet in perfect order, the book shelves yet unfur.&#xD;
wished, it looked a very abode of comfort. For there were&#xD;
basking sunbeams and a blazing fit'e, there were shelves&#xD;
and cupboards of various size and shape, there were win~&#xD;
dows-.-not very large, it is true, but giving such views !~&#xD;
of the fair country below, and the brook, and the ascent,&#xD;
and the distant blue peaks of the range. Warm-coloured&#xD;
curtains and carpet and couch had been put here under Mr.&#xD;
Oi~yphant's orders, and here were things of Mr. Linden's&#xD;
which Faith had never seen~-his escritoire and study tahh~&#xD;
among others. Her table, with a dainty easy~chair, at the&#xD;
prettiest of all the windows, she knew at a glance-un~&#xD;
known as it was before; hut the desk which she had had&#xD;
long ago stood on the study table, nearer his. Mr. Linden&#xD;
brought her up to the fire, and stood silent with his arms&#xD;
wrapped about her for a minute. Then he stooped and&#xD;
kissed her.&#xD;
"How does it look, Sunbeam ?"&#xD;
Faith was grave, and her eye went silently from one&#xD;
thing to another cven after he spoke; then turned its full&#xD;
sunny answer upon him. Faith certainly thought he did&#xD;
too mach for her; but she spoke no such thought, leaving&#xD;
it as she had once meant to leave other thoughts, for&#xD;
action.&#xD;
"You can put your books right in, and then it will be&#xD;
beautiful," she remarked. "And look down the mountain,&#xD;
out of that window, Endecott !-"&#xD;
She was taken over to the window for a nearer view and&#xD;
placed in her easy-chair to take the good of it.&#xD;
"Do you see that little red speck far down at the foot;&#xD;
of the' hill ?" Mr. Linden said-" in that particularly rough&#xD;
steep place ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"That is the best thing we can get for a church at&#xD;
present."&#xD;
Faith thought it would be a very.good sort of a "thing"&#xD;
when he was in it; but as usual, she did not tell all her&#xD;
&#xD;
thoughts. They came back to her easy-chair and table,&#xD;
and from them to Mr. Linden's face, with a look which said&#xD;
"How could you ?".-But he only smiled, and asked her if&#xD;
she felt disposed to go over the rest of the house.&#xD;
For a house that was not in order, this one was singu-&#xD;
larly put to rights. Boxes and packages and trunks there&#xD;
were in plenty, rolls of carpet and pieces of bedsteads, and&#xD;
chairs and tables and everything else; but they were all&#xD;
snugly disposed by the wall, so that the rooms could be&#xD;
entered and the windows reached. The inside of the cot-&#xD;
tage was, like the outside, irregular, picturesque, and with&#xD;
sufficient capabilities of comfort. The kitchen was in a&#xD;
state of nicety to match that of Best; in a piece of ground&#xD;
behind the house, partly prepared for a garden, Maithus was&#xD;
at work as composedly as if they had all been settled in the&#xD;
White Mountains for the last ten years.&#xD;
Lunch was taken somewhat infQrm ally; then the riding&#xD;
habit being changed for a working dress, Faith set about&#xD;
reducing the rebellion among boxes and furniture. Best&#xD;
had reason presently to be satisfied not only with the man-&#xD;
tiers but the powers of her new mistress; though she also&#xD;
judged in her wisdom that the latter needed some restric-&#xD;
tion in their exercise. Gentleness was never more efficient.&#xD;
The sitting-room began to look like a sitting-room; tables&#xD;
~ and bookshelves and chairs marched into place. Mean-&#xD;
while Faith had been getting into pleasant order one of&#xD;
the rooms up stairs, which with what Mrs. Olyphant had&#xD;
done was easy; enjoying the mountain air that came in&#xD;
through the window, and unpacking linen and china. Mr.&#xD;
Linden on his part had been as busy with some of the&#xD;
rougher and heavier work,-opening boxes and unpacking&#xD;
books; and especially taking care of Faith-which last&#xD;
work was neither rough nor heavy. She was amused (edi-&#xD;
fled too) at the new commentary on his former life which&#xD;
this day gave her: to call upon servants when they were&#xD;
present, seemed as natural as to do without them when they&#xD;
were absent. Faith mused and wondered a little over the&#xD;
old habit which showed itself so plainly-thinking too of&#xD;
his life in Pattaquasset.&#xD;
The day had worn on and faded, and Faith was still&#xD;
busy, in a hunt for some of her wedding presents which she&#xD;

wanted to have on the tea-table. But Mr. Linden for 50lfl~&#xD;
time had missed her; and entering upon a tour of search,&#xD;
found her in a large closet near the kitchen, with a great&#xD;
deal chest on' one side .and a trunk on the other. Between&#xD;
the~i, on her knees, Faith was laying out package after&#xD;
package, and pile after pile of naperies lay on the floor&#xD;
around her. In the very height of rummaging, tl)ough&#xD;
with cheeks evidently paled since the morning. Mr. Linden&#xD;
took an expressive view of the subject.&#xD;
"Mignonette, 1 want my tea."&#xD;
"Yes !" said Faith eagerly looking up and then at her&#xD;
work again,-"just so soon as I find some things-.-."&#xD;
"I don't want 'things '-I want tea."&#xD;
"Yes-but you can't have tea without things."&#xD;
"I will be content with six napkins and ten tablecloths-.&#xD;
just for to-night, as we are in confusion."&#xD;
"And no spoons ?" said Faith. "Here they are&#xD;
"Yes-h ere they are," said Mr. Linden, "and here is&#xD;
everything else! Just look at the state of the floor-for&#xD;
me to walk over."&#xD;
"Not at all," said Faith,--"please keep out. I will&#xD;
have tea ready very soon, Endy."&#xD;
"You shall not have anything ready,"-and Faith found&#xD;
herself lifted from her kneeling position and placed in a&#xD;
not Wncomfortable nest of packages. "Now, Mrs. Linden,&#xD;
whatever of these things your hands may touch, shall lie&#xD;
on the floor all night. But as you see, my hands have a&#xD;
different effect." And swiftly and surely the "things"&#xD;
began to find corner mom in the closet.&#xD;
"Endy !" said Faith catching his hands,-" please don't!&#xD;
Just go away, and leave me here for three minutes."&#xD;
"Not for one.-I'll turn them all out again in the worn-&#xD;
mg, after the most approved fashion."&#xD;
Faith sat down, the swift colour in her cheeks testifying&#xD;
to a little rebellion. It was swift to go, however, as it had&#xD;
been to come; and she sat still, looking on at Mr. Linden's&#xD;
work, with a little soberness of brow. That broke too, when&#xD;
she met his eye, in a very frank and deep smile.&#xD;
"Well?" he said, laughing and leaning back against the.&#xD;
closet door.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Will you let me go and get tea now ?" she said with&#xD;
the same look.&#xD;
"You pretty child !-No, I want Best to get t~ea-and&#xD;
you to be quiet."&#xD;
"I'll come and be quiet in three minutes, Endy,-after I&#xD;
get rid of the dust,".-she said winningly.&#xD;
"Genuine minutes? If Ariel 'put a girdle round the&#xD;
earth' in forty, you should be able to put one round your&#xD;
waist in three-I suppose that is included in a feminine&#xD;
'getting rid of the dust'."&#xD;
Faith's face promised faithfulness, as she ran off towards&#xD;
the kitchen; where in less than three minutes she and Best&#xD;
had proved the (sometimes) excellence of women's business&#xD;
faculties. Meantime a strange man lifted the latch of the&#xD;
kitchen door, and carefully closing it after 'him remained&#xD;
upon the scene of action.&#xD;
"How d'ye do," he said. "Is the new man come?"&#xD;
"Everybody's new here," said Faith. "Whom do you&#xD;
mean&#xD;
"Couldn't tell ye the first word! But I've been after&#xD;
him better'n three times, if he aint,"-4he m~n spoke as if&#xD;
it was " worse" instead of better.&#xD;
"Whom do you mean ?" said Faith more gravely ;~~-J' the&#xD;
minister?"&#xD;
"Now that's what I call hitting the nail," said her visi-&#xD;
~ ter. "Well if he's here, just tell him to come up the&#xD;
mounUng, will ye ?"&#xD;
"When?"&#xD;
"Moon sets close on to nine-and its lighter afore&#xD;
that."&#xD;
"Where is the place?" said Faith, now 'very serious in-&#xD;
deed ;-" and what do you want the minister for ?"&#xD;
"I don't want him, bless you !" said the man. "If I did,&#xD;
I shouldn't be standing' here. It's an old soul up our way.&#xD;
lie's got to go up to the bridge~ and over the bridge and&#xD;
otherr side of the bridge-and so on till he comes to it.&#xD;
And the bridge is slippy." With which summing up, the&#xD;
man turned to the door, rattling the latch in a sort of pre-&#xD;
paratory way, to give Faith a chance for remarks.&#xD;
"But who wants him there-and what for? you haven't&#xD;
told me."&#xD;

doqr.&#xD;
"Why won't to-morrow do as well as to-night ?"&#xD;
"W~al" said the man slowly,-"s'pose it might. N~~q&#xD;
ertheless, to-morrow aint worth much to him. Nobody'd&#xD;
give much for it."&#xD;
"Why?"&#xD;
"'Taint certain he'd get what he paid for."&#xD;
"Is he very sick?"&#xD;
"Very enou~h-.&#xD;

Faith sprang forward. "Stop a minute-will you, friend&#xD;
-and see Mr. Linden."&#xD;
"That's his name !-as sure as guns," said he of the&#xD;
'mounting.' "No, thank'ee, I don't care about seem'&#xD;
him now-next .time'l1 do just as well, and it's time he&#xD;
was off."&#xD;
"Then wait and shew him the way, will you? how is he&#xD;

"Do tell !" said the man slowly, "if he can't find his way&#xD;
round in the moonlight ?"&#xD;
A "Better than moat people," said Faith; "but Ii think he&#xD;
~ would like to see you."&#xD;
The man however chose to defer that pleasure also to&#xD;
"next time," and went off. Faith went Th the study.&#xD;
Coining up behind Mr. Linden where he was sitting, and&#xD;
laying both hands on his shoulders, she said in a very low&#xD;
and significant voice, "Endy-some one wants you."&#xD;
Only that you never assert your claims," he said, bring.&#xD;
ing the hands together, "I should suppose it must be the&#xD;
very person whom I want."&#xD;
Her head stooped lower, till the soft cheek and hair lay&#xD;
against his. But she only whispered, "Endy-it is some&#xD;
one up the mountain."&#xD;
"Is it ?" he said, rousing up; but only turning his lips&#xD;
to her cheek. "Well-people up the mountain must have&#xD;
what they want. Is it now, Faith ?"&#xD;
"Endy-they say it's a dying man."&#xD;
"Where? Is the messenger here ?"&#xD;

"I couldn't make him wait-he thought he had business&#xD;
somewhere else. The place is-I dare ~y Malthus knows&#xD;
.-up the mountain, beyond the bridge--you are to go over&#xD;
the bridge and on till you come to the house. And he says&#xD;
the bridge is slippery." Only a fine ear could detect the&#xD;
little change in Faith's voice. But she knew it was no-&#xD;
Peed, from the smile on the lips that kissed her, two or&#xD;
three times. Then Mr. Linden disengaged himself and&#xD;
rose up.&#xD;
"Faith," he said, "you are to wait tea for me, -and&#xD;
in the mean time you must take one of 'Miss Bezac's&#xD;
cups of comfort and lie down on the sofa and go to sleep.&#xD;
Your eyes will be just as good guiding stars sleeping as&#xD;
waking."&#xD;
She said not another word, but watched him go off and&#xD;
out into the half dark wilderness. The moon shone bright&#xD;
indeed, but only touched the tops of many a woody outline,&#xD;
and many a steep mountain side rose up and defied her.&#xD;
Faith smelled the wi~I sweet air, looked up and down at&#xD;
the gleams of light and bands of shadow; and then came&#xD;
back to the study where the fire blazed, and sat down on&#xD;
the floor in front of it. Gazing into the red coals, and fob&#xD;
lowing in fancy Mr. Linden on his walk and errand. It&#xD;
took him away from her, and so many such an errand&#xD;
would, often; but to speak comfort to the dying and tell&#xD;
the truth to the ignorant. Faith gloried in it. He was an&#xD;
'i ambassador of Christ; and not to have him by her side&#xD;
~ would Faith keep him from his work. That he might do&#xD;
his work well-that he might be blessed in it, both to&#xD;
others and himself, her very heart almost fused itself in&#xD;
prayer. So thinking, while every alternate thought was a&#xD;
l)etition for him, weariness and rest together at last put her&#xD;
~ to sleep; and she slept a dreamless sweet sleep with her&#xD;
head on Mr. Linden's chair.&#xD;
She awoke before he got back, though the evening was&#xD;
long set in. Feeling r&amp;amp;reshed, Faith thought herself at&#xD;
liberty to reverse orders and went to the forbidden closet&#xD;
again, and to further conjurations with Best. They could&#xD;
notQ have taken long; for when, some hour later, Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den was nearing the house on his return, he had a pretty&#xD;
view of her, standing all dressed before the fire in his study.&#xD;

The glow shone all over her---he, could see her well, aiia&#xD;
her fresh neatness. He could see more. Faith Linden to~&#xD;
night was not just the Faith Derrick of old time; nor even&#xD;
of six months ago. The old foundations of character were&#xD;
all there, intact; but upon them sat a nameless grace, not&#xD;
simply of cultivation7 nor of matured intelligence, nor even&#xD;
of happiness. A certain quiet elegance, a certain airy dig.&#xD;
nity-which had belonged to her only since she had been&#xD;
ilL". Linden's w~fe. She stood there, waiting now for him&#xD;
to come home.&#xD;
The firelight caught behind her the 'gleam of silver,&#xD;
whether Mr. Linden could see it or not, where the little&#xD;
chocolati~re stood brilliant. Faith had found that in her&#xD;
last rummaging. Miss Bezac's new trencher and bread&#xD;
knife were on the table too, with a loaf of Mrs. Olyphant's&#xD;
bread; and the fireshine gleamed on Mr. Aldott's salt&#xD;
cellars, and on the Mignonette tea service. Faith evidently&#xD;
had pleased her ftincy. But now her fancy had forgotten it&#xD;
or left it in the background; and for what, was well shewa&#xD;
by her spring as she caught the sound of the coming step.&#xD;
She met Mr. Linden at the door, gladness in every line and&#xD;
movement, and yet the same grace over all her action now(&#xD;
that a minute before was in all her repose. She said&#xD;
nothing at all.&#xD;
£&#xD;
'Watching for me, my dear child !" he said. "Faith, you&#xD;
have been on my heart all these hours."&#xD;
She waited till he had come up to the fire, and then&#xD;
softly inquired, "What for ?"&#xD;
"'What for no' ?" he said smiling, but giving her face a&#xD;
somewhat earnest consideration. "Have you been asleep ?"&#xD;
"Yes. And then I thought I might gd after my choco-&#xD;
late pot, in the closet."&#xD;
"Sensible child! What did you think upon the great&#xD;
question of setting forth to see me safe over the bridcre ?"&#xD;
Her face changed, though smiling. She whispered,-&#xD;
"I did see you safe over it." But his lips were grave in-&#xD;
stantly, and the eyes even flushed. And Faith could see&#xD;
then that he was exceedingly tired. Gently her hands&#xD;
rather insinuated than pushed him into the chair, and she&#xD;
ran away to give an orders coming' back to do two or&#xD;
three other things for his comfort. Still silent, standing&#xD;
&#xD;
there beside his chair, she presently stooped and put her&#xD;
fresh sweet lips to his. Roses full of dew are not sweeter;&#xD;
and if roses were sentient things their kisses could not give&#xD;
sympathy more flagrantly, nor with more pure quiet.&#xD;
Holding her fast, Mr. Linden asked what she thought of&#xD;
her share of clerical duties, on the whole?&#xD;
Faith answered somewhat quaintly, "Not much."&#xD;
"You don't !-What a triumph for Miss Essie. Were&#xD;
you lonely, Faith ?"&#xD;
She was going to answer, then sprang away from him,&#xD;
for Malthus came to the door. And the table was spread,&#xD;
with as dainty exactness as if there were no disorder any.&#xD;
where in Mr. Linden's household. The little chocolati~z'e&#xD;
steamed out its welcome, Malthus was gone, and Faith&#xD;
stood by Mr. Linden's chair again.&#xD;
"It is ready, Endecott."&#xD;
He had watched her from under, the shadow of his hand,&#xD;
-her soft arranging steps and touches. "Faith," he said&#xD;
looking up, "is this the night when I am to have sugarless&#xD;
tea-to remind me of the over-sweetened cup of long&#xD;
ago?"&#xD;
Her smile and flash of the eye were conscious as well as&#xD;
bright. "I guess sugar is 'potent' yet, Endy."&#xD;
"You are !-" he said. "Have you been lonely, my dear&#xD;
child ?-.You don't answer me.",&#xD;
She hesitated a very littler "I felt you were away,&#xD;
Endy-but I didn't wish you here. No, I wasn't lonely."&#xD;
his eyes spoke a full understanding of both parts of her&#xD;
sentence. But his words touched somewhat else.&#xD;
"Those poor people up on the mountain !-poor as un-&#xD;
belief could make them. Faith, I must go there again in&#xD;
the morning."&#xD;
"Is it far ?"&#xD;
"Pretty far. On the crest of, the ridge."&#xD;
"What about them, Endy ?"&#xD;
"What were you looking for, here in the embers ?"&#xD;
"I ?-" she said, the colour instantly starting as she uu~&#xD;
derstood his question. "I was looking for you, then."&#xD;
"I was sure of it. I saw myself distinctly portrayed in&#xD;
a piece of charcoal."&#xD;
She laughed, gaily and softly. "Wouldn't you like to&#xD;

500             SAY AND SEAL.&#xD;
&#xD;
have some tea, and then tell me what you saw up on the&#xD;
mountain ?"~~she whispered.&#xD;
"Ah little Sunbeam," he said, "I spent some weary hours&#xD;
there. No, I don't want to tell you about it to-night. And                                        6&#xD;
so at last I came home,-.thinking of the scene I had been ~&#xD;
through, and of you-left alone here in this strange place,&#xD;
And then I had that vision of my wife."&#xD;
She was silent, her face showing certainly a grave con-&#xD;
sciousness that he was tired and a full entering into the&#xD;
feeling of his work; but for herself, a spirit as strong in its&#xD;
foundations of rest, as full of joy both in his work and in&#xD;
him-as a spirit could be. So till her eyes met his, then&#xD;
the look broke in a winsome little confessing smile, and the (&#xD;
eyes fell.&#xD;
"Don't you want something better than visions ?" she&#xD;
said.&#xD;
"Is that a challenge ?"-lle laughed and rose isp, carry.&#xD;
ing her off to her place at the table, and installing her with&#xD;
all the honours; and still holding her by the shoulders&#xD;
asked "if she felt like the head of the house ?"&#xD;
"No indeed 1" said Fiiith.&#xD;
"What then?"&#xD;
"You know-" said Faith colouring-" What I am."&#xD;
"Mrs. Endecott, I suppose. I have noticed, Mignonette"&#xD;
said Mr. Linden as he went round to his chair, "that when&#xD;
ever you see fit to agree with me it is always in your own&#xD;
words !"&#xD;
Which remark Faith. benevolently answered with a cup&#xD;
of cocoa, which was good enough to answer anything.&#xD;
