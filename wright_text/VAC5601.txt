They strive foray few years with fate, and perish!
Why not perish to night those men of despair in
yonder ship ? why not to-night, as well a forty
years 'hence ? 'Twill be the same in the end!
Ah, they have missed stays! The gale has her
in the teeth ! She drives landwardi They may
now fold their hands, say their last prayer-as

yet handsome face.
"As much. If man dead be no more than a
fish dead,,then there can be no God I"
"1What knowest thou ? Leave me ! Or rath-
erastay, if thou wouldst like to see men die with
drowning, calling on God, who hears never the

"Thou art an infidel! 'Hadst thou believed,

"Nay I care. not for my head; but I would
not like the king to have the sweet satisfaction

""Lord Robin, thou art wicked enough to
bring the red lightnings down on this old tower

low ! Crest thou for naught ?"
" Nay, nurse good one, I will tot shock thy
faith.  Albeit, I marvel that thou hast any
Christianity in thy soul, since they say thou art
a witch and hast compacts and covenants with
Sathanas ! They do say thou hast bought a
thousand years o' life, over and above, and for
this guerdon cold him thy soul. .But I heed not
these slanders, thoeknowest," added Lord 'Rob-

age. "I like thee, because thou wert my nurse
in childhood; and I thank thee after thou wert
grown old, and hadst got such reputation for
dealings with evil spirits, thou host given me
shelter in this old dungeon, whither the hatred
of thy race bath driven thee. But watch the
ship. Hear how bellow their guns ! aid the blue
smoke jets out and' appears for an instant, and
then vanishes into thin air like the prayers of
the poor wretches on board."
"If it 1were possible t serve them, my Lord
Robin," said the old nurse, with an anxious gaze
upon the vessel which was now driving toward
the cliff! "If there were but a boat and strong
men to go in it !"
"And whataveil I Let then die to-day and
they will not not live and;sin to-morrow," an-
swertd the nobleman.- "And die, they will, for
nothing can save them! Go!"-
His attention was now-fixed upon the barque.
Theoruarineru finding that it was in vain to try
longer to weather the le 'shore, seemed to be
seeking out:place to drive upon where theashapo
of the shore offered the best chances for esape.
The commander could be seen at the hehis steer-

to the sea-side.' Lord Robin, from his elevation,
could look dotn upon her decks as a bird fly

of inen risible who were stationed at yepe's; ad

The nobleman, in his Irregular movements up
and down the stone floor, passed unconsciously
through the wide arch that afforded communal-
cation between the room occupied by the dame,
and was there pacing to and fro, deep in his dark
thoughts, when he suddenly stopped, with an
exclamation! -
A broad stream of moonlight poured through
-         the lofty lattice, like a silver river, and fell bright-
ly upon the face of the sleeping child ! It
lighted up its golden hair, lent a radianceofsuper"
natural glory toits fair brow, and revealed a face
such as seraphs must have in heaven ! Lord
Robin paused and gazed as if he had seen a
vision. He held his breath and remained mo-
tionless, as if he feared a step  , cause it to
\,          vanish. Save the face of th '   a'll else was
in obscurity, the bed, the muffie head of the old
dae--and out of, and, from the  'dst of the
darkness, was revealed the lovely sight, such as
Lord Robin thought could not appertain to
earth.        -
"If sleeping demons have been permitted to
visit me, and madden me with horrors unspeak-
able," he said, mentally, "waking, I behold an
angel ! Yet this fair sight must be human, for I
see the moving lips and.smile of one pleasantly
dreaming; and the living heartlifts the vestment
with its undulations ! I will draw near and see
what means this sweet vision."       -
He bent over the lovely child. Its rich hair
was still wet. He wondered whence it had come.
Aslightfrown contracts its forehead. A troubled
look crosses the face.
"Hama! dear papa ! Let me not drown !"
it murmurs, and turns restlessly.
The careful lname even in her sleep seemed to
-ear and ,be conscious of her precious charge.
Por without waking, she seemed to answer:
"I willsave thebabe ! I will throw out the
line as the under-tow drives the dead man this
way! I have it ! TheUe catches thebodyby

"Be it so !" he answered, yielding. "Hark !
I hear those men near ! Secrete me, and betray
me not," he said, quickly.
" This way, Lord Robin," she replied ; but her
face was strangely altered in its expression.
He followed her along a passage betweenthe
walls of the tower and a row of half ruined apart-

to a stone door which led into a deep excava

But before she could prevent it, the little girl

She was going to pursue her, when two men,

expression of igddescribable despair upon her
face, she suddenly: shrieked with, an appalling
cry, and losing her footing, reeled and-pitched
headlong out of .sigh.
,he ofcer ehoe4 her shriek with a voice bf
hor-ro,; and beading over, saw her descending,
turning over andi overin her progress, until she
struck the sea and disappeared in its depth.
",ather thyself, old dame, than this fair child,
wham thou wouldst have cast over to this dread-
ful 4patit! Thou wilt rest sound enough arneath
the wave till abriel's trump. And now, ,my
swet little angel, I trust thou art not-eriously
hurt 1,Ymy flinging thee ao rudely down as i
caught thy hand ; but it was my only chance for
thee 1"
And he laid down the torch which he bad held
tiiow, to raise her up.., At this crisis he was
,Noined by hi, lieutenant, and hastening with
their lovely burden down to the court, where
there wag. a well of water, tey speedily revived
AeW, with its refreshing .coldness. WAqn she
cnie to, she looked fearfully around, and then
"0, let her not have ne I She will hill me,
and drown mein the seal"
"No-ado not fear, ay sweet child," he said,
tenderly., "She is dead, herself,. in the seali
you shallsoon. be safe with a kind mother, and
with everybody who will love you and pet youi
pd make you forget yoursorrow and tears"
"O,shallI    0,takemetodear motheit .-I
hayentsgen her since she was in the big ship in
the naughty storm!"
" (O- at once to the hamlet inn, Antonio," said
the officer, "and order three horses for me!
Have them here at once. 'Tis but thee miles."
This order was addressed to his servant, a
young Spanish lad %of eighteen (whgse lifes
story in itself was full of romance enough for a
tale, if we had time to tell it), who, answering,
"Si, senorP quickly disappeared on his errand.
The officer now laid his cloak folded upona
stone- bench, and placing the littlegirIupon it
with tenderness, soothed her with promises of
goon being at home. In W lttle'tima she fell
asleep,4ith her bead upen his-arm,.
"Was ever epeated thing so. lovely I" he sqid,
half aloud, as heassd upon her.A "AA orphan

Peroy,"he said to his young lieutenant; "andas
it is -iow daybreak, wo:shall have light to aid
us."
A searchwas, now uinstituted of the closest
character. More than once those who sought
the noble passed-the wal -wherein he was con-
cealed. He heard ;their: voices, and gathered
enough to know: that they were, indeed, as his
fears foretold, looking for him. *He thanked old
Alice in his heart forthe secure place In which
she had so carefully hidden him, and feeling se-
cure, he laid down on-the hard rock-to try to get
some rests trusting' that when he awaked, his
pursuers trould havelefte the tower. Suddenly
a shriek far above him in the air, startled him,!
Then-a dark body passed like a descending rock
by a little window in the cliff. He was unable
what to make of it. But it was the falling body
of the woman !  Again be slept. When he next
. aked, they dad departed It was high noon,
and they had been gone two hoars-Captain
Makers, satisfied that the, nobleman had es-
caped-bini by leaving the tower at the outset, on
seeing him land..Lord:Robin could see that it
was lay bya light that cam, through the breath-
ing hole,,or smalwindowsin the rock, that look-
ed towards the sea. It was not large enough to
put his head out of, yet sufficiently so to afford
himelight rad air,s and a prospect of the ocean ;
and even,:by putting hit face close to it, he could
dis rnthe topmasts ofthe armed, schooner lay-
ing-  under the cliff

devils, no one knoweth which; and I do not
want to hear such sounds again."        -
"Where was it, fatherI I recollect that last
year, when we came down here from the hamlet
where we liveyou said thafrobbers were haunt-
ing here."
" Yes,,robbers and ghosts, and Sathan, it may
be. It is a bad old place, and I ne'er heard good
come o't. Once it was dwelt in, some dozen
years or so ago, by an arrant witch, Dame
Alice; and one night, in a storm, the devil fiew
off with her from the tower top and dropped
her, shrieking awful, in the sea I Some say she
believed that she could fly, and so jumped
off, in her folly, and was drowned at the bottom
of the cliff. Her ghost haunts the place ever
since! Sometimes she is seen dancing a tot o'
yon rock, and sometimes skipping about e'
moonlit nights on the sea below I"
"Hast seen her, father ?"
"tany a-time I But I always gave her a
wide berth; for I could hear her scream lo g
before she was in sight."
"Perhaps it was a curlew, father ?"
"4r sounds avery' deal like, one, boy; but a
witch can imitate any sound. But this is not
the worst. There has been heard most awful
criescoMing out from tUndpr the- tower. They
seemted"to bein the vary 'bowels of the rock.
Onetught, it may be ten years age, this yery
mgonth,.or there-bout, I was catching mackerel
off the tower. There had been a great storm,
tvp nighis before, and a shipwas wrecked, and
not a s#ulsjyed, And4y ,that toleh I,ret4ember
theniglt well. Jacob, my brother, and I were,
in teboat.. ,All at once the stillness was broke
by a terrible gry thatseemed to come from the
mi4d-air. WeVere well frightened, and Jacob's
line slipped through his Augers i to these, and
I lost the best book I Qwned, and a line sixty
fathoms long."
"But the cry, father?' What was it T"
I Isoundd'like some fiend shut up in' the
bowels of the cliff. It was a most dreadful
soun&amp;amp; as ever human ears heard. It seemed to
cry for help-and then it would' roar and yell
like a wild beast. ' We were so'near the clif hat
iae pulled out, as fast as we could use out oats,
aid &amp;amp;a6ie to'our comrades -in 6e other boats,:
who also' were frightened' atthe ,aoise; and

their courage gave us courage, and we landed,
and armed with our boat hooks and fish knives,
seven of us in all, we got up to the tower."
"You were very bold, father,!"
"We were very scared, boy, and a har eross-
ing our path, would have made us run away
back again. When we got near the tower, just
about where you see that larch tree, we were all
startled by the cries again; for we had not heard
them since we -landed. They now seemed to
come from below and out in the air. The
bravest men drew close to the cliff edge and
said the sounds were not from the tower, but
were from the middle air-and that it was not
from an earthly. being. We trembled, but still
listened, till we were assured that they were not
in the air, but far below. This discovery not a
little amazed us, and as they grew more and
more horrible, we did not long delay in return-
ing to our boats. When we got to them, we
could hear the shriek above us ! By.and-by
'teyf eased,,and we pulled off, and for my part,
I have never fished there again by night."

Thus gratulating himself, the young and sub-

thoughts, with a feeling of resentment against
himself for loving one so obscure, and against

had seen the weird woman appear from among

that side, and rapidly made his way to theforest.
He beheId the gray figure of the old woman
moving swiftly in the direction, of the ancient
church. He followed, and saw her disappear

ment upon the lovely face, eaeh Instant thelight
of maternal recognition brightening her conate-
stance,.

   9"A gnes t do you'  yow r, qear mothefa,
voice ?" she suddenly called out with anuch
-emotion
"Mother-O, my mother I       dmy  ear, dear
motherY",tied Agnes, extending herhanda, " I
hear you -I know those tones I You at aiy
own-my lost-4ay beloved another I"'
In an instant they were folded in one another"
arms, and so clung they together that it seemed
they would mingle into one.. Lady Monteagle
wept, and ,Dame Alice let the tears trickle an.
heeded adown'her wrinkled 'chgeks..
A few days passed of such happiness as earth
seldom bestows upon its.children.- The time at
length arriyed that, theearl shoAld return to his
post at Madrid. Lady Plan-William counted
to accompany there with Agnes, who nowwould
not for a moment be. separated froa kernew-
,found modter. The earl had insisted that Agnes
ought to go to 'Spain, for he said he had heard
there of the reputation of a great Arabian ma.
gician and -alebymist, who had restored sight to
the eyes of many blind persons.
"It was our intention,/ he said; to .ady
ClauMilliamny "to have taken her back with-us,
that the skill of this person, who. often' comes
into Spain from Barbary;'may he tested i her
case."              -'       '
"Whatever holds out any hope for the recov-
ery of her sight, mustitot b untried," said her
mother; and so it wad decided'that they should
sail with them.
Three wgka afterwards, the wholepartywere,
in London, waiting the -sailing'of their frIgdte.
At the hotel where they lodged, the earlhappily
met lkis Mend, Lord Devonu whom he had:not
seen for some years, and who'wan onthe eve of

"Behold thy patent I" said the earl, conduct

Arab, in his turn, was now visibly under the in.
fluence of some sudden emotion. .
"He trembles1-he doubts!- He must not he

At this moment he stood before Agnes. He
had no sooner beheld her than a new agitation
seemed to seize him. He started back l7-,~e
seemed about to fall! But recovering himself,
he said, firmly:
" My lord, I will cure her !"
"Agnes, wilt thou consent ?" asked Lady.De-

trust my life in his hand."I
"He shall try! I have full trust in himi"
she answered, in a voice tremulous, and liquid
with some strange inward joy.

had given to him. His hand trembl-aldthe

as he-drew the golden stoppers. But when he
took up the first vial,-to pour into those beauti-

twin heavens from beneath, his hand became
firm.
The cr1Mse#oil overflowed thefaireyes, which
seemed to be filled with blood to the sight of
those who gazed on. He then-took the vial of

folk to whispering about the apparition of an old
friar, who a sheral occasions (as averred by
the poasanta) had been seen flitting among the
Ivy-anled stones, or stoping over the broken
.slabs Io the anetent burial-place. But the work
of restoration was never, commenced, though It
was asserted that commissioners from the king
had actually visited the place, and (as was said)
entered upon negotiations with artisans. How-
ever, there was very good reason why the de-,
sign of rebuilding the abbey (if such, indeed,
had been entertained) should not be completed;
for about this period the pious James was forced
to pack up his 'royalty, and decamp for the
French court, whilst his dutiful daughter Mary,
and his-son-in-law William of Nassau, took quiet
possession of his crown and kingdom.

Will Nutta, as the pedler was-named, expected
that it would soon .spend its force, and pass
away, leaving him, to be sure, the wet fields for
his journey, butwith the returning moon to

duration of the tempest, which continued to rage
with unabated fury till hours had passed away,
and he began to reckon midnight very near at

"Now, Master Nuttall was a stout-hearted
and merry fellow, little troubled by ghoststo-
ries, though was he in the habit of relating to tho
wide-mouthed lads'and round-eyed.lasses, who
ever welcomed him to meat and lodging in their
snug farm-houses. Nevertheless, the reflection

a htert look of every object around him.

" Talkingthus to himself, and peering boldly
'abouthin , as l4e saw the sunlight brightening in
the east, Will shook himself, and proceeded to*
inipagt animation to his benumbed limbs .by a
likralestowal of smart buffets on his breast.
Theokid gray tombs began, by thistne, to look
chery in the morning bpams, and the ivied
.arches agd shagered wals had jost all trace of

den ag     fan opening just linpath t se gray
tomb; nedclose beside the hatdsment which hadl
so op.rtunely covered' his person.. The pedler
steeped, a4 beheld a square aperture, halfi-ou-
ceded.by dak weeds, below which were several
5gppsjof aftone, apparently leading to a vault he'
nt    the enumnent. Into this operturo he
peered curiously, but all was dark. Only a
s*pof damp earth came from beneath. Will
Niatt l       isued a few moments, and then a
stage fancy came Into his mind. 'If ghosts
mnst havehols to go and come by,' quoth he,
they be little better off than peoplewi' bodies,'
This fleqtioni pspIring him,he hesitate not to
pust~spept foot through the square opening
andi descend cautiously the slippery~stones...

mined on his course of action. The treassee
could not all be-removed at once, but it was not
long before he had convoyed it, by piecemeal, to-
his little warehouselatthe market-town. Then
ha gave outthat he should no longer pursue the
hawker's trade, but. enlarging his sbop, seen
branched out into cautious speculation, u.ntil
begot thereputatiqn of a thriving tradesman,
worthy of nll respect.

that it became necessary for a public appeal to

Nuttall; and he straightway sotbscribed twenty

that had spoken, that ha rubbed his spectacles
thrice, as he looked at the figure. Then, Uid-

e not surprised," said the youth, as he no.
ticed the bewildered look of the maiden, "for I
have lately received an appointment in the
army. And I was sent to these old ruins to-
night, with my regiment, to surprise a band of
banditti, who are supposed to have their rendez-
vous within its old walls. And I have obtained
indubitable evidence of the Baron Lord Bldred
do Gottingen being the leader of this terrible
band, which has so long infested this forestaad
been a terror to travellers in these parts." ** T
He then conducted the maiden within the
shade of a large pillar, at some distance off,
where she would be safe from harm during the
expected conflict. He then returned to his men#.
in order to place them in an advantageous posi-
tion &amp;amp;  the approaching combat, which he did
by dividing them in two parties, and placing
one on either side of the road.
Hardly had the preparations been hastlyexa
ented, when the party appeared in sight, at a
short distance off, coming at a moderate pace;
for the broken columns and walls, together with
the brambles and thorns which grew thickly
about, presented a. strong impediment to their
faster progression. As they proceeded, every
hedge and projecting column was searched.
But when they caught sight of the soldiers,
drawn up in such formidable array to receive
them, they all drew rein, as if by common conF
sent. The baron, who rode infront, turned pale
with a guilty consciousness that his schemes,
whatever they may have been, were discovered.
But his confusion was but momentary, for, turn.
ing to his men, he gave a few orders in a low
tone; when the whole party wheeled asoand,
and started off from the place.I
But this was only a feint of -thebaron's to di-
vert the attention of his antagonists, so as to set
them In pursuit, and then suddenly charge on

bat. These who were not k  imre soe tely
