"You must have a preface, Sut; your book will then be ready. What shall I write?" "Well, ef I must, I must; fur I s'pose the perducktion cud no more show hitsef in publick wifout hit, than a coffin-maker cud wif out black clothes, an' yet what's the use ove either ove em, in pint ove good sense? Smells tu me sorter like a durned humbug, the hole ove hit-a littil like cuttin ove the Ten Cummandmints intu the rine ove a warter-million; hits jist slashed open an' the inside et outen hit, the rine an' the cummandmints broke all'tu pieces an' flung tu the hogs, an' never tho't ove oust-them, nur the 'tarnil fool what cut em thar. But ef a orthur mus' take off his shoes afore he goes intu the publick's parlor, I reckon I kin du hit wifout durtyin my feet, fur I hes socks on. "Sumtimes, George, I wishes I cud read an' write, jis' a littil; but then hits bes' es hit am, fur ove all the fools the worild hes tu contend wif, the edicated wuns am the worst; they breeds ni ontu all the devilment a-gwine on. But I wer a-thnkin, ef I cud write mysef hit wud then raley been my book. I jis' tell yu now, I don't like th3 idear ove yu writin a perduckshun, an' me a-findin the brains. 'Taint the fust case tho' on record by a durned site. Usin uther men': brains is es lawful es usin thar plunder, an' jis' es common, so I don't keer m    h noo    dusn 'speck this yere perduckahun will th o 'nve      ht  v  nt  hm   u h  tali olwa     8:X rtI'PRMEFACE. sit purfeckly quiet oltu the stumicks ove sum pussons--them hu hes a holesum fear ove the devil, an' orter hev hit, by geminey. Now, fur thax speshul well-bein hercarter, I hes jis' this tu say: Ef yu ain't fond ove the smell ove cracklins, stay outen the kitchin; ef yu is fear'd ove smut, yu needn't climb the chimbley; an' ef the nioon hurts yer eyes, don't yu ever look at a DItch cheese. That's jis' all ove hit. "Then thar's sum hu haint much faith in thar repertashun standin much ove a strain; they'll be powerful keerful how an' whar they reads my words. Now, tu them I haint wun word tu say: they hes been preached to, an' prayed fur, now ni ontu two thousand years an' I won't dart weeds whar thuty-two poun shot bounces back. "Then thar's the book-butchers, orful on killin an' cuttin up, but cud no more perjuce a book, than a bull-butcher cud peijace a bull. S'pose they takes a noshun tu stick, skin, an' cut up this yere one. Ef they is fond ove sicknin skeers, I advises em tu take holt tu oust; but fust I begs tu refer em respectively tu the fate ove three misfor tinit pussons menshun'd inside yere-Passun Bullin, Dock Fabin, an Sheriff DolLon. Read keerfully what happened tu them afore yu takes eny ove my flesh ontu yer claws, ur my blood ontu yer bills, an' that I now is a durnder fool then I wer in them days, fur I now con- siders mysef a orthur. I hes tuck my stan amung the nashuns ove the yeath, fur I, too, hes made me a book, so ef enybody wants dish rags, I thinks hit wud be more healthy fur em not tu tare em ofen my flag. "Mos' book-weavers seem tu be skeery folks, fur giner'lly they cums up tu the slaughter pen, whinin an' waggin thar tails, a-sayin they 'knows they is imparfeek'-that 'yu'd scaee 'speck one ove my ge,' an' so forth, so on, so along. Now ef I is a-rowin in that boat, I   ' PliEFACE.            xi ain't awar ove hit, I ain't, fur I knows the tremenjus gif I hes fur breedin skeers amung durned fools, an' then I hes a trustin reliance ontu the fidelity, injurance, an' speed ove these yere laigs ove mine to tote me an' my sins away beyant all human ritribushuns ur revenge. Now, 'zamin yer hans, ole ferrits an' weazels, an' ef yu don't hole bof bowers an' the ace, yu jis' 'pass' hit. "Ef eny poor misfortinit devil hu's heart is onder a mill-stone, hu's raggid children am hungry, an' no bread in the hdesser, hu is down in the mud, an' the lucky ones a-trippin him every time he struggils tu his all fours, hu hes fed the famishin an' is now hungry hissef, hu misfortins foller fas' an' foller faster, hu is so foot-sore an' weak that he wishes he wer at the ferry-ef sich a one kin fine a laugh, jis' one, sich a laugh as is remembered wif his keerless boy- hood, atwixt these yore kivers--then, I'll thank God that I hes made a book, an' feel that I hev got my pay in full. "Make me a Notey Beney, George. I wants tu put sumwhar atween the eyebrows ove our book, in big winnin-lookin letters.

"WELL, Sut, your stories are all ready for the printer; to whom do you wish to dedicate the work?" "I don't keer much, George ; haint hit a kine ove lick- skillet bisness, enyhow-sorter like the waggin ove a dorg's tail, when he sees yi eatin ove sassengers? But yere goes : How wud Anner Dickinson du tu pack hit ontu?" "Oh, Sut, that would never do. What! dedicate such nonsense as yours to a woman?  How will this do?

Why, if that wer tu git out onto me, I'd never be able tu mix in decent s'ciety while I lived. Tare that up, George." "Well, what do you say to this, Sut?

These and like expressions were addressed to a queer looking, long legged, short bodied, small headed, white haired, hog eyed, funny sort of a genius, fresh from some bench-legged Jew's clothing store, mounted on "Tearpoke," a nick tailed, bow necked, long, poor, pale sorrel horse, half dandy, half devil, and enveloped in a perfect net-work of bridle, reins, crupper, martingales, straps, surcingles, and red ferreting, who reined up in front of Pat Nash's grocery, among a crowd of moun- taineers full of fun, foolery, and mean whisky. - -?:i-This was SUT LOVINGOOD.

The ole man Skissim an' his wife went tu a nite meetin, an' tuck the ballance ove his ur rather her brats -a feller shu'd allers be pow'ful keerful in speakin on that pint.

They lef him sittin ontu a split-bottom cheer, plum asleep all over, even tu his ole hat. I tuck about thuty foot ove clothes line, an' tied him tu the cheer by his neck, body, an' arms, levin his laigs loose. He looked sorter like the Lion in the spellin-book, when the rat wer a-cuttin a fish net off ove him. That wern't a skeer'd rat, wer he? I hed him safe now tu practize on, an' I sot in tu duin hit, sorter this way: I painted his face the culler ove a nigger coal-burner, scept a white ring roun his eyes; an' frum the corners ove his mouf,   lj          OLD SKISSIM'S MDDLE BOY.       69 sorter downards, slouch-wise, I lef a white strip.

He look't savidge es a sot steel trap, baited wif asnick, an wer jis' fit fur tresun, straterjim, an' tu spile things. Tu this day, when I dreams ove the devil, dad, Passun Bullin, an' uther orful oppressive things, that infunel boy, es he look't that nite, am durnd intermitly mix't wif the hole ove em.

I screw'd ontu each ove his years a par ove iron han- vices, what his dad squeezed ole clocks, an, crac't war- nuts wif, an' they hung down like over-grow'd year- rings; I tied a gridiron tu wun ankil, an' a par ove fire-tongs tu tuther; I pour'd a bottil ove groun red- pepper down his back, onder his shut; I turn'd loose a pint ove June-bugs, what I kotoh apupus, intu his buz- zum, an' buttoned em up; I tied'a baskit full ove fire crakers tu the cheer back, tu his har, an' tu his wrists; I button'd up a big grey-whisker'd aggravated ole rat, tied wif a string intu the slack ove his britches; tuther aind ove the string wer fas' ontu his gallus button, an the rat, like all the res' ove that tribe, imejuntly sot in cuttin his way out; but owin tu his parvarse nater ur the darkness ove the place, he sot in tu cuttin the wrong way; he wer a workin towards the back-bone, an' fur- der frum the britches, every cut  I learnt this fac' frum the cheer risin frum the flure, an' fallin agin jis'  70     OLD SKISSIM'S MDDLE BOY. tu rise imejuntly a littil higher, an' sum souns, a mix- try ove snort, snore, grunt, an' groan, which he wer be- ginin tu isoo tolabil fas', an' gettin louder every bounce ove the cheer, an' becumin more like ontu a howl every pop. In the beginin ove his oneasines he dream'd ove wagin whip, nex' he dream'd ove a tea-kittil es big es a still, an' lots ove bilin wartar, an' nex he drempt ove bof ove 'em; an' now he wer a dreamin that the tea- kittil wer a steam ingine, a drivin the waggin whip, an' a cottin gin wif red hot saws fifteen hundred licks a minit, an' that he wer in the cottin hopper.

A few hundred more gwine off, still hevin the rat, pepper, an' insex tu back em, got him wide enuf awake tu bleve that he wer threatened wif sum orful pussonal calamerty, what wanted pow'ful quick work on his part tu dodge. He wer awake now all over, even tu his durnd ole hat, an' he show'd hit in es meny ways es a cat dus, lock'd up in a empty room wif a strange an' interprisin big dorg.
